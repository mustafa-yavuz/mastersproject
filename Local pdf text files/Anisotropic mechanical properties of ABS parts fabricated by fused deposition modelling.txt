Layered manufacturing (LM) methods have traditionally been used for rapid prototyping (RP) purposes, with the primary intention of fabricating models for visualization, design verification, and kinematic functionality testing of developing assemblies during the product realization process (Caulfield et al., 2007). Without any need for tooling or fixturing, LM allows for the computer-controlled fabrication of parts in a single setup directly from a computerized solid model. These characteristics have proven beneficial in regard to the objective of reducing the time needed to complete the product development cycle
