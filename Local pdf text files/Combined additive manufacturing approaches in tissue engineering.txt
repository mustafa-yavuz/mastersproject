Advances introduced by additive manufacturing (AM) have signiﬁcantly improved the control over the
microarchitecture of scaffolds for tissue engineering. This has led to the ﬂourishing of research works
addressing the optimization of AM scaffolds microarchitecture to optimally trade-off between conﬂicting
requirements (e.g. mechanical stiffness and porosity level). A fascinating trend concerns the integration
of AM with other scaffold fabrication methods (i.e. ‘‘combined” AM), leading to hybrid architectures with
complementary structural features. Although this innovative approach is still at its beginning, signiﬁcant
results have been achieved in terms of improved biological response to the scaffold, especially targeting
the regeneration of complex tissues. This review paper reports the state of the art in the ﬁeld of combined
AM, posing the accent on recent trends, challenges, and future perspectives.
