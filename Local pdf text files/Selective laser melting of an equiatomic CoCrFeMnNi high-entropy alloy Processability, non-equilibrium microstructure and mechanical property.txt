The selective laser melting (SLM) of an equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) powder was
studied, with emphasis on its non-equilibrium microstructural evolution and mechanical properties. The
printed sample density increases gradually with increasing laser energy density and then decreases at an
over-high laser energy density. The microstructure of SLM printed HEA exhibits a large number dislo-
cation pile-ups and lattice distortion. Of particular intrigue are the existence of nanotwins and tetragonal
s phase in SLM printed HEA; such nanotwins and s phase have never been observed in either cast or
deformed HEA with true strain below 3.7%. The grain reﬁnement by rapid solidiﬁcation and s phase
synergistically improve the mechanical properties, as compared with conventionally solidiﬁed HEA. Hot
isostatic pressing (HIP) was performed to improve the densiﬁcation, yielding the increase of tensile
strength from 601 MPa of SLM printed sample to 649 MPa after HIP.
