Selective electron beam melting (SEBM) was successfully used to fabricate novel cellular Ti–6Al–4V structures for orthopaedic applications.
Micro computer tomography (lCT) analysis demonstrated the capability to fabricate three-dimensional structures with an interconnected
porosity and pore sizes suitable for tissue ingrowth and vascularization. Mechanical properties, such as compressive strength
and elastic modulus, of the tested structures were similar to those of human bone. Thus, stress-shielding effects after implantation might
be avoided due to a reduced stiffness mismatch between implant and bone. A chemical surface modification using HCl and NaOH
induced apatite formation during in vitro bioactivity tests in simulated body fluid under dynamic conditions. The modified bioactive
surface is expected to enhance the fixation of the implant in the surrounding bone as well as to improve its long-term stability.
