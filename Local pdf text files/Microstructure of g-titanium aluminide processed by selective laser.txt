The present study deals with a b-solidifying titanium aluminide processed by Selective Laser Melting
using prealloyed g-TiAl powder. In particular the effects of energy density and preheat temperature on
chemical composition and microstructure were investigated to acquire suitable process parameters.
Tensile tests carried out at room temperature and 850 (cid:1)C demonstrate that strengths in the range of
conventionally produced material can be achieved.
