This paper presents the research done to determine
the functional relationship between process parameters and
tensile strength for the fused deposition modelling (FDM)
process using the group method for data modelling for prediction
purposes. An initial test was carried out to determine
whether part orientation and raster angle variations affect the
tensile strength. It was found that both process parameters
affect tensile strength response. Further experimentations
were carried out in which the process parameters considered
were part orientation, raster angle, raster width and air gap.
The process parameters and the experimental results were
submitted to the group method of data handling (GMDH),
resulting in predicted output, in which the predicted output
values were found to correlate very closely with the measured
values. Using differential evolution (DE), optimal process
parameters have been found to achieve good strength simultaneously
for the response. The mathematical model of the
response of the tensile strength with respect to the process
parameters comprising part orientation, raster angle, raster
width and air gap has been developed based on GMDH, and
it has been found that the functionality of the additive
manufacturing part produced is improved by optimizing the
process parameters. The results obtained are very promising,
and hence, the approach presented in this paper has practical
application for the design and manufacture of parts using
additive manufacturing technologies.
