Knowledge of the mechanical properties of parts processed by Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) rapid prototyping process is essential for engineering applications of such parts as the mechanical strength of parts depends heavily on the FDM process parameters selected during part fabrication.  Little knowledge is available for the Polycarbonate (PC) material used in the FDM systems. This paper presents results of the experimental work on the effect of the FDM process parameters such as air gap, raster width, and raster angle on the tensile properties of PC.  Results show that FDM made parts have tensile strength in the range of 70 to 75 % of the moulded and extruded PC parts. The results will be valuable for different functional applications of FDM produced parts and assemblies
