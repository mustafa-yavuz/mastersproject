AlSi 10Mg cylinders produced by laser powder-bed fusion have somewhat different yield behavior for cylinders with XY orientation and Z orientation. Earlier yielding for Z-oriented samples is likely related to micro-residual stress, resulting from the difference in thermal expansion of the aluminum matrix and cellular silicon. Smaller tensile reduction in area of Z-oriented samples is related to tearing along the softer region at the boundaries of melt pools, where the silicon cell spacing is larger. Indentation measurements conÔ¨Årmed the lower hardness at the edges of melt pools.
