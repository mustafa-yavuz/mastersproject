Formula Student is a worldwide project for engineering students to design, build and race a small single seater racing car. The teams have to cope with rules and restrictions which concern specifications of the car such frame, engine and safety. Motorsport sector demands lightweight vehicle concepts without sacrificing performance. In that direction, high stiffness to-weight ratio must be accomplished to almost every component of the car. Consequently, the design for manufacturing is crucial to Formula Student teams. Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a technology that can effectively meet the requirements for reduced weight and high stiffness components, in contrast with convectional manufacturing processes such as milling or turning. In this work, the main guidelines for designing an Additively Manufactured part are presented and optimization techniques using ANSA and Tosca software tools are analyzed, in order to propose a redesign for a structural part of a Formula Student racecar based on AM. The AM process advantages and the flexibility offered in designing and manufacturing of complex components lead to a lighter structural part, achieving equivalent stiffness validated following extensive FEA analysis. Finally, this work tries to overcome implications of current CAD programs that are considered inadequate for designing for AM and explore the design freedoms of AM in order to get the most out of it
