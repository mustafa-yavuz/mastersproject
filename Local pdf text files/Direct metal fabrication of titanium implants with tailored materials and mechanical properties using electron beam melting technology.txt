The design of custom or tailored implant components has been the subject of research and development for decades. However, the economic
feasibility of fabricating such components has proven to be a challenge. New direct metal fabrication technologies such as Electron Beam Melting
(EBM) have opened up new possibilities. This paper discusses the design and fabrication of titanium implant components having tailored
mechanical properties that mimic the stiffness of bone to reduce stress shielding and bone remodeling. Finite Element Analysis was used to design
the tailored structures, and results were verified using mechanical testing.
