In recent years, the SLM process has been studied for the production of aluminum alloy parts, as these 
alloys demonstrate significant potential for the future, notably due to their low density which allows a 
considerable reduction in mass. The aim of this bibliographical study is to identify and classify the 
parameters and phenomena which influence the appearance of defects in aluminum alloy parts 
produced using the SLM process and hence the final properties of these parts. To do this, a cause tree 
diagram was created. For each defect or consequence identified (porosities, defects linked with hot 
cracking phenomena, anisotropy in the material and surface quality), we revealed the potential sources 
of the appearance of this defect, going back to the initial causes
