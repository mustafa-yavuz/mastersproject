In this study, 316L parts were fabricated with the selective laser melting additive layer 
manufacturing process using unidirectional laser scan to control their texture. The melt pool 
shape, microstructure and texture of three different cubic samples were analyzed and quantified 
using optical microscopy and electron back-scattered diffraction. The samples scanned along 
the shielding gas flow direction were shown to exhibit shallow conduction melt pools together 
with a strong {110}<001> Goss texture along the laser scanning direction. The sample prepared 
with a laser scan perpendicular to the gas flow direction had deeper melt pools, with a weaker 
{110} <001> Goss texture in addition to a <100> fiber texture parallel to the scanning direction. 
Correlations were proposed between the melt-pool geometry and overlap and the resulting 
texture. The decrease of the melt pool depth was assumed to be linked to local attenuation of 
the laser beam effective power density transmitted to the powder bed.
