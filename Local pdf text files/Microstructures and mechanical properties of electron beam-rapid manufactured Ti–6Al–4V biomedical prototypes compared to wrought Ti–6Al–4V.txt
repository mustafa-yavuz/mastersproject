This study represents an exploratory characterization and comparison of electron-beam
melted (EBM) or rapid manufacturing (RM) of Ti–6Al–4V components (from nominal 30 μm
diameter powder) with wrought products. Acicular α and associated β microstructures
observed by optical metallography and electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) are compared
along with corresponding tensile test and hardness data; including the initial powder
particles where the Vickers microindentation hardness averaged 5.0 GPa in comparison
with the fully dense, EB manufactured product with an average microindentation hardness
ranging from 3.6 to 3.9 GPa. This compared with wrought products where the Vickers
microindentation hardness averaged 4.0 GPa. Values of UTS for the EBM samples averaged
1.18 GPa for elongations ranging from 16 to 25%. Biomaterials/biomedical applications of
EBM prototypes in direct prosthesis or implant manufacturing from CT or MRI data are
discussed in the context of this work, especially prospects for tailoring physical properties
through EB control to achieve customized and optimized implant and prosthetic products
direct from CT-scans.
