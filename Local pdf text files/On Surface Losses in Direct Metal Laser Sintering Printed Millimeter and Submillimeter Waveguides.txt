Different lengths of WR3 (220–330 GHz) and WR10 (75–110 GHz)
waveguides are fabricated through direct metal laser sintering (DMLS). The losses
in these waveguides are measured and modelled using the Huray surface roughness
model. The losses in WR3 are around 0.3 dB/mm and in WR10 0.05 dB/mm. The
Huray equation model is accounting relatively good for the attenuation in the WR10
waveguide but deviates more in the WR3 waveguide. The model is compared to finite
element simulations of the losses assuming an approximate surface structure similar
to the resulting one from the DMLS process.
