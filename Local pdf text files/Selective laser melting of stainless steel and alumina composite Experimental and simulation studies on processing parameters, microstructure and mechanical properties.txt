Metal matrix composites (MMC) ﬁnd their uses as high performance materials. The selective laser melting (SLM)
of a 316L stainless steel and Al2O3 MMC is presented in this paper. Agglomerate Al2O3 particles had shown to be
an adequate powder choice with uniform dispersions in the resultant prints. Relative density, phase, microstruc-
ture and mechanical properties of all 1-, 2-, 3-wt% doped products were carefully analyzed. Finite element model-
ing model was developed to study the associated multi-physics phenomena with high efﬁciency for process
parameter optimization. It is found that the change in SLM temperature proﬁle with Al2O3 addition is mainly
due to the change in optical properties rather than thermal. Hence, both simulation and experimentation re-
vealed that higher laser energy input is needed for optimized melting. In addition, cellular dendrites were
found to coarsen with increasing Al2O3 addition due to the decreased cooling rate. With hard particle strength-
ening effects, all samples showed improved hardness with 3-wt% up to 298 HV and 1-wt% samples showing
much improved yielding and tensile stresses of 579 and 662 MPa from 316L. Corresponding microlattice built
this way demonstrated a 30 and 23% increase in speciﬁc strength and energy absorption from that of 316L too.
