Today, the use of material extrusion processes, like fused deposition modeling (FDM), in aerospace, biomedical science, and other industries, is gaining popularity because of the access to production-grade thermoplastic polymer materials. This paper focuses on how modifying process parameters such as build orientation, raster angle (RA), contour width (CW), raster width (RW), and raster-to-raster air gap (RRAG) can improve ultimate tensile strength (UTS), Young’s modulus, and tensile strain. This was assessed using three methods: default, Insight revision, and visual feedback. On average, parameter modiﬁcation through the visual feedback method improved UTS in all orientations, 16% in XYZ, 7% in XZY, and 22% in ZXY
