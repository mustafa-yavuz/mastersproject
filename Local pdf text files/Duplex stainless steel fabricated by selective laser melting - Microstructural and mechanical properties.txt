In the scope of the present study, microstructural and mechanical characterizations of
duplex stainless steel UNS S31803 processed by selective laser melting (SLM) are
conducted. The findings shed light on the phase arrangement evolving in the as-built
condition and in several heat-treated conditions. In the as-built condition, austenite
formation is almost suppressed due to process-related high cooling rates. Therefore, several
heat treatments ranging from 900 °C to 1200 °C for 5 min each were performed in order to
adjust to the desired austenitic-ferritic microstructure. Results generated by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) reveal a high dislocation density induced during SLM
fabrication, such that a recrystallized microstructure prevails after the heat treatment. Tensile
tests display the severe impact of the heat treatment on the resulting mechanical response.
The nearly complete ferritic as-built specimens obtain a higher ultimate tensile strength and
a reduced elongation at fracture compared to the heat-treated specimens.
