Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is a novel class
of rapid manufacturing process that can fabricate functional
parts of any complexity. However, the DMLS process takes
almost 6â€“12 h to build parts of even small-moderate size.
Reducing the build time of the parts is the key to success of
the DMLS process at commercial level. A common solution
to reduce the part build time is to sinter the parts with maximum
allowable layer thickness. However, doing so will make
staircase effect more prominent and lead to the poor surface
accuracy of the part. In this paper, a bi-criteria-based optimization
approach is presented to address this issue. The subprocesses,
namely, part orientation, layer thickness identification,
and laser scanning directions, are optimized with an aim
to build the parts with: (a) minimum amount of time and (b)
minimum surface inaccuracy. In addition, the material shrinkage
is also incorporated in the proposed model. Parts with
varying complexities are analyzed to elucidate the applicability
of proposed approach. Comparisons with traditional slicing
approaches are also made.
