3D gel-printing (3DGP) is a new printing method, which is based on a 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) gelation system to produce complex shape parts. In this study, the 3DGP process based on a water-based gelation system was used to prepare zirconia (ZrO2) ceramic parts. The water-based ZrO2 ceramic slurry with a solid volume fraction of 50 vol% was prepared and its rheological property was characterized. The surface roughness is Ra 8.90 µm on the printed green sample, and Ra 8.25 µm on the sample after sintered at 1520 °C for 2 h. The relative density, the Vickers hardness and the transverse rupture strength of the sintered sample are 97.6%, 14.4 GPa and 450 MPa, respectively.
