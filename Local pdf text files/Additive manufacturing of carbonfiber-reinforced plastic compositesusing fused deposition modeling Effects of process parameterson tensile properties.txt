Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites have been intensively used for many applications due to their attractive
properties. The increasing demand of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites is driving novel manufacturing processes
to be in short manufacturing cycle time and low production cost, which is difficult to realize during carbon fiberreinforced
plastic composites fabrication in common molding processes. Fused deposition modeling, as one of the
additive manufacturing techniques, has been reported for fabricating carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites. The
process parameters used in fused deposition modeling of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites follow those in fused
deposition modeling of pure plastic materials. After adding fiber reinforcements, it is crucial to investigate proper fused
deposition modeling process parameters to ensure the quality of the carbon fiber-reinforced plastic parts fabricated by
fused deposition modeling. However, there are no reported investigations on the effects of fused deposition modeling
process parameters on the mechanical properties of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites. In the experimental
investigations of this paper, carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composite parts are fabricated using a fused deposition
modeling machine. Tensile tests are conducted to obtain the tensile properties. The effects of fused deposition modeling
process parameters on the tensile properties of fused deposition modeling-fabricated carbon fiber-reinforced plastic
composite parts are investigated. The fracture interfaces of the parts after tensile testing are observed by a scanning
electron microscope to explain material failure modes and reasons.
