Layer Manufacturing (LM) technologies like Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) were developed in the late 80â€™s as techniques for Rapid Prototyping (RP). Today, SLS - as well as its derived technology Selective Laser Melting (SLM) - is used as well for prototyping, tooling and manufacturing purposes. This widening of applications is caused mainly by the possibility to process a large variety of materials, resulting in a broad range of physical and m echanical properties.  This paper presents a survey of the various binding mechanisms in SLS and SLM, which are responsible for the broad range of materials and applications. Basic binding mechanisms involve solid state sintering, chemically induced binding, liquid phase sintering, partial melting and full melting. Many subcategories can be distinguished based on the type of structural or binder powder composition: single component powder grains (single material or alloy), composite powder grains, mixtures of different powder grains, distinct binder material (sacrificial or permanent), etc. The paper will explain how these binding mechanisms apply for sintering various types of materials: plastics, metal, ceramics and composites (e.g. glass reinforced polymers, cermets, hardmetals, etc.). It gives a survey of research done at the University of Leuven, Belgium, as well as at other European and non-European organizations.
