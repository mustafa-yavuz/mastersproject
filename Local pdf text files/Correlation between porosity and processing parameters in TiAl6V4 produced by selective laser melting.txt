This study presents the correlation between process parameters and porosity formation in a TiAl6V4 alloy produced by selective laser melting.The porosity is investigated by 2D and 3D methods aiming to identify the mechanisms of void formation, their morphology as well as volume fraction as a function of the energy density. An evident minimum volume fraction is observed between process parameters with signiﬁcant over heating and insufﬁcient fusion. It is shown that these two marginal regions deﬁne two mechanisms of void formation. Two dominant types of voids morphology are identiﬁed and examined regarding pore orientation versus their elongation,which together with the curvature distribution analysis allow revealing critical defects.
