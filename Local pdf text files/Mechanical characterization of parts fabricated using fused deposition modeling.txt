Layered manufacturing is anevolution of rapid prototyping (RP) techniques where the part is built in layers. While most of the previous applications focused on building “prototypes”, recent developments in this ﬁeld enabled some of the prototyping methods to achieve an agile fabrication technology to produce the ﬁnal product directly. A shift from prototyping to manufacturing of the ﬁnal product necessitates broadening of the material choice, improvement of the surface quality, dimensional stability, and achieving the necessary mechanical properties to meet the performance criteria. The current study is part of an ongoing project to adapt fused deposition modeling to fabrication of ceramic and multi-functional components. This paper presents a methodology of the mechanical characterization of products fabricated using fused deposition modeling
