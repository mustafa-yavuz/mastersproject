Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) of thermoplastic materials is generally a well-known technology among all additive manufacturing (AM) technologies and therefore, it is essential to investigate the mechanical properties of such FDM processed materials.  Several open-source and low cost AM machines, known as 3D Printers, have recently been developed using thermoplastic extrusion process based on the original FDM technology.  Many of these 3D Printers use Polylactic Acid (PLA) plastic for building parts. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the tensile properties of the PLA thermoplastic material processed by the Cube-2 3D Printer.  In this study, the dog-bone sized PLA specimens are printed in different build orientations and a Zwick Z010 tensile testing machine is used to determine the tensile properties of PLA in different build orientation
