Employing selective laser melting direct microstructure
manipulation is feasible through adjustment of thermal
gradients and solidification velocity. Currently, the
exposure strategy and laser energy have to be adapted in
order to meet a processing window suited for introducing
highly anisotropic microstructures. As selective
laser melting allows for production of filigree complex
structures, the impact of geometry on the microstructure
evolution is investigated in the current study and it is
shown that miniaturization of structures as well leads to
the evolution of anisotropic microstructure
