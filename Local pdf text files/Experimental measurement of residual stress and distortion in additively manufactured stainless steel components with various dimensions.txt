Disk-shaped 316L stainless steel parts with various diameters and heights were additively
manufactured using a direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) technique. Neutron diffraction was
used to profile the residual stresses in the samples before and after removal of the build plate and
support structures. Moreover, distortion level of the parts before and after the removal was
quantified using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). Large tensile in-plane stresses (up to â‰ˆ
400 MPa) were measured near the as-built disk top surfaces, where the stress magnitude
decreased from the disk center to the edges. The stress gradient was steeper for the disks with
smaller diameters and heights. Following the removal of the build plate and support structures,
the magnitude of the in-plane residual stresses decreased dramatically (up to 330 MPa) whereas
the axial stress magnitude did not change significantly. The stress relaxation caused the disks to
distort, where the distortion metric was higher for the disks with smaller diameters and heights.
The distribution of the residual stresses revealed a marked breakdown of self-similarity in their
distribution even comparing disk-shaped samples that were fabricated under identical printing
parameters; the stress field profiles were not linearly scaled as a function of height and diameter.
