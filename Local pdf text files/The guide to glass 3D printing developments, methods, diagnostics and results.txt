Purpose – This purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the steps and processes behind successfully adapting novel materials, namely virgin
glass and recycled glass, to three-dimensional printing (3DP).
Design/methodology/approach – The transition from 3DP ceramic systems to glass systems will be examined in detail, including the necessary
modifications to binder systems and printing parameters. The authors present preliminary engineering data on shrinkage, porosity, and density as
functions of peak firing temperature, and provide a brief introduction to the complexities faced in realizing an adequate and repeatable firing method
for 3D printed glass.
Findings – Shrinkage behavior for the 3D printed recycled glass showed significant anisotropy, especially beyond peak firing temperatures of 7308C.
The average shrinkage ratios for the slow- and fast-axes to the Z-axis were 1:1.37 and 1:2.74, respectively. These extreme differences can be attributed
to the layer-by-layer production method and binder burn-off. At 7608C, the apparent porosity reached a minimum of 0.36 percent, indicative of
asymptotic behavior that approaches a fully dense 3DP glass specimen. At low firing temperatures, the bulk density was similar to water, but increased
to a maximum of 2.41 g/cm3. This indicates that 3DP recycled glass can behave similarly to common glass with accepted published bulk densities
ranging from 2.4-2.8 g/cm3.
Research limitations/implications – Heating schedule analysis and optimization may reduce geometric variations, therefore, the firing method
should be investigated in greater depth.
Originality/value – This paper provides a guide to successfully adopting glass to commercially available 3DP hardware. This research has also enabled
rapid prototyping of recycled glass, a monumental step towards a sustainable future for 3DP.
