Fused deposit ion modelling(FDM) is a fast growing rapid prototyping (RP) technology due to it s ability to build functional parts having complex geometrical shape in reasonable time period. The quality of built parts depends on many process variables. In this study, ﬁve important process parameters such as layer thickness, orientation, raster angle, raster width and air gap are considered. Their inﬂuence on three responses such as tensile, ﬂexural and impact strength of test specimen is studied. Experiments are conducted based on central composite design (CCD) in order to reduce experimental runs. Empirical models relating response and process parameters are developed. The validity of the models is tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Response surface plots for each response is analysed and optimal parameter setting for each response is determined.The major reason for weak strength may be attributed to distortion within or between the layers.Finally,concept of desirability function is used for maximizing all responses simultaneously
