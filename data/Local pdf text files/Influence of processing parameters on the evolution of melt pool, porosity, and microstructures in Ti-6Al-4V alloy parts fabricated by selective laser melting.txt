Selective laser melting involves melting and
solidification of metal powder particles in a track-by-track
and layer-by-layer method to fabricate 3D parts. The present
investigation focuses on understanding the effect of
laser power and scan speed on the evolution of melt pool,
porosity and multiple thermal cycling effects on the
microstructure in parts fabricated using selective laser
melting. In this study, Ti-6Al-4V pre-alloyed powder was
used to produce single-track deposits and bulk parts. Using
different combinations of laser power and scan speeds,
single-track deposits and bulk parts were produced. The
cross-sections of the single-track deposits and bulk samples
were prepared for metallographic observations and the melt
pool shape and size and porosity were evaluated. When a
low energy density was applied the un-melted powder
particles produced irregularly shaped porosity, and a high
energy density resulted in rounded porosity, which was due
to keyhole effects. The samples produced with a proper
combination of power and speeds were fully dense. Further,
microstructural development under the influence of
process condition was highlighted. Overall, the study
demonstrates a good correlation between the single-track
melt pool geometries, porosity in bulk parts and also
demonstrates the microstructural inhomogeneity during
deposition.
