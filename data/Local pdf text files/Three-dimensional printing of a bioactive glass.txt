We report on three-dimensional printing and subsequent sintering of 13-93 bioactive glass as a powerful method for the fabrication of patient-specific inlays and substitutes for unloaded implants. In a multi-method study, an assessment of thermal sintering, isotropic and anisotropic shrinkage, crystallisation and microstructural evolution was performed as a prerequisite for the development of a suitable 3D-printing and sintering process. Concave and convex model geometries were then produced, and their consolidation behaviour was examined with respect to process parameters such as adequate preparation of precursor glass powders, particle size used, glass viscosity, green body preparation and sintering conditions. Almost complete densification could be achieved for sintering temperatures of 742–795°C. Crystallisation was observed to involve subsequent precipitation of diopside (~750°C), parawollastonite (~850°C) and calcium phosphate (~900°C). A process window of 712–745 °C reducing to 712–730 °C, if crystallisation must be avoided, is suggested for sintering of 3D printed bioactive glass type 13–93
