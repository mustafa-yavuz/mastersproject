Metallic additive manufacturing techniques, in particular the selective laser melting (SLM) process, are capable of fabricating strong, lightweight and complex metallic lattice structures. However, they still face certain process limitations such as geometrical constraints and in some cases the need for support structures. This study evaluates the manufacturability and performance of SLM produced periodic cellular lattice structures, which are designed by repeating a unit cell type called gyroid consisting of circular struts and a spherical core. The effect of unit cell size on the manufacturability, density and compression properties of the manufactured cellular lattice structures were investigated. Microcomputer tomography (CT) scan results reveal that the gyroid cellular lattice structures with various unit cell sizes ranging from 2 to 8 mm can be manufactured free of defects by the SLM process without the need of additional support structures. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs show that the lattice structures made by SLM have a good geometric agreement with the original computeraided design (CAD) models, but many partially melted metal particles are bonded to strut surfaces. The struts within the gyroid cellular lattice structures with smaller unit cell sizes have higher densities due to their shorter scan vector lengths in the SLM process. The yield strength and Youngâ€™s modulus of the Gyroid cellular lattice structures increase with the decrease in the unit cell size due to the denser struts of the lattice structures with smaller unit cell sizes.
