This   densiﬁcation   behavior   and   attendant   microstructural   characteristics   of  the   selective   laser   melting
(SLM)   processed   AlSi10Mg   alloy   affected   by   the  processing   parameters   were   systematically   investigated.
The   samples   with   a  single   track   were   produced   by   SLM   to   study   the  inﬂuences   of   laser   power   and   scan-
ning   speed   on  the   surface   morphologies   of  scan   tracks.   Additionally,   the   bulk   samples   were   produced   to
investigate   the  inﬂuence   of   the   laser   power,   scanning   speed,   and   hatch   spacing   on  the   densiﬁcation   level
and   the   resultant   microstructure.   The   experimental   results   showed   that   the  level   of   porosity   of   the   SLM-
processed  samples   was   signiﬁcantly   governed   by   energy   density   of   laser   beam   and   the   hatch   spacing.
The   tensile   properties   of   SLM-processed   samples   and   the   attendant   fracture   surface   can   be   enhanced   by
decreasing   the   level   of  porosity.   The   microstructure   of   SLM-processed   samples   consists   of   supersaturated
Al-rich   cellular   structure   along   with   eutectic   Al/Si   situated   at   the   cellular   boundaries.   The   Si  content   in   the
cellular   boundaries   increases   with   increasing   the   laser   power   and  decreasing   the   scanning   speed.   The
hardness   of  SLM-processed   samples   was   signiﬁcantly   improved   by   this   ﬁne   microstructure   compared
with   the   cast   samples.   Moreover,   the  hardness   of   SLM-processed   samples   at   overlaps   was   lower   than   the
hardness   observed   at   track   cores.
