This article reviews published data on the mechanical properties of additively manufactured metallic materials. The additive manufacturing techniques utilized to generate samples covered in this review include powder bed fusion (e.g., EBM, SLM, DMLS) and directed energy deposition (e.g., LENS, EBF3). Although only a limited number of metallic alloy systems are currently available for additive manufacturing (e.g., Ti-6Al-4V, TiAl, stainlesssteel,Inconel625718,andAl-Si-10Mg),thebulkofthepublished mechanicalpropertiesinformationhasbeengeneratedonTi-6Al-4V.However,summarytablesforpublishedmechanicalpropertiesandorkeyÔ¨Ågures areincludedforeachofthealloyslistedabove,groupedbytheadditivetechniqueusedtogeneratethedata.Publishedvaluesformechanicalproperties obtained from hardness, tensioncompression, fracture toughness, fatigue crack growth, and high cycle fatigue are included for as-built, heat-treated, and or HIP conditions,when available.The effects of test orientation build direction on properties,when available,are also provided,along with discussion of the potential source(s)(e.g.,texture,microstructurechanges,defects) of anisotropy in properties. Recommendations for additional work are also provided.
