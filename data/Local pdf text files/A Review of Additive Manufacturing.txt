Additive manufacturing processes take the information from a computer-aided design (CAD) ﬁle that is later converted to a stereolithography (STL) ﬁle. In this process, the drawing made in the CAD software is approximated by triangles and sliced containing the information of each layer that is going to be printed. There is a discussion of the relevant additive manufacturing processes and their applications. The aerospace industry employs them because of the possibility of manufacturing lighter structures to reduce weight. Additive manufacturing is transforming the practice of medicine and making work easier for architects. In 2004, the Society of Manufacturing Engineers did a classiﬁcation of the various technologies and there are at least four additional signiﬁcant technologies in 2012. Studies are reviewed which were about the strength of products made in additive manufacturing processes. However, there is still a lot of work and research to be accomplished before additive manufacturing technologies become standard in the manufacturing industry because not every commonly used manufacturing material can be handled.The accuracy needs improvement to eliminate the necessity of a ﬁnishing process.The continuous and increasing growth experienced since the early days and the successful results up to the present time allow for optimism that additive manufacturing has a signiﬁcant place in the future of manufacturing.
