This paper addresses foams which are known as non-stochastic foams, lattice structures, or repeating open
cell structure foams. The paper reports on preliminary research involving the design and fabrication of
non-stochastic Ti–6Al–4V alloy structures using the electron beam melting (EBM) process. Non-stochastic
structures of different cell sizes and densities were investigated. The structures were tested in compression
and bending, and the results were compared to results from ﬁnite element analysis simulations. It was
shown that the build angle and the build orientation affect the properties of the lattice structures. The
average compressive strength of the lattice structures with a 10% relative density was 10 MPa, the ﬂexural
modulus was 200 MPa and the strength to density ration was 17. All the specimens were fabricated on the
EBM A2 machine using a melt speed of 180 mm/s and a beam current of 2 mA. Future applications and
FEA modeling were discussed in the paper.
