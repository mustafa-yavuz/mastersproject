Additive manufacturing of near-net-shaped dense ceramic components has been established via room-temperature direct writing of highly loaded aqueous alumina suspensions in a layer-by-layer fashion. The effect of alumina solid loading on rheology, specimen uniformity, density, microstructure, and mechanical properties was studied. All suspensions contained a polymer binder (~5 vol.%), dispersant, and 51–58 vol.% alumina powder. Rheological measurements indicated all suspensions to be yield-pseuodoplastic, and both yield stress and viscosity were found to increase with increasing alumina solid loading. Shear rates ranging from 19.5 to 24.2/s, corresponding to viscosities of 9.8 to 17.2 Pas, for the 53–56 vol.% alumina suspensions were found to produce the best results for the 1.25-mm tip employed during writing. All parts were sintered to >98% of true density, with grain sizes ranging from 3.2 to 3.7 lm. The average ﬂexure strength, which ranged from 134 to 157 MPa, was not inﬂuenced by the alumina solid loading.
