Additive manufacturing (AM) has become a versatile and diversified technology that has made a huge difference in how things are
being manufactured. Substantial growth has been observed in the development of ceramic materials for AM processes. However,
ceramic parts manufactured by AM methods often exhibit deficiencies in mechanical properties and performance. Recent research
developments have included improvement of performance and mechanical properties by introducing a material preparation process
and additional post-processing techniques to improve the fabrication process. This paper contemplates and reviews the advancements
made in AM techniques to fabricate high-performance ceramic (HPC) materials, also known as advanced ceramics. AM
processes are classified as per ASTM standards and the technologies implemented are sub-listed. The principles, mechanical
properties, advantages, disadvantages, applications, and limitations of each technology are described in detail.
