The differences of microstructure and mechanical properties of die steel
(1.2709) prepared by selection of laser melting (SLM) process and traditional
casting-forging process were studied. Sample A was prepared by SLM process.
Sample B was prepared by mixing process (half volume using conventional casting—
half volume of forging process application SLM). Sample C was prepared by traditional
casting–forging process. Three sets of samples were subjected to the same
process of solution treatment and aging treatment. The microstructures and
mechanical properties of the three groups were studied. The results showed that the
microstructure of sample A was a homogeneous and dense plate-like martensite
structure, and they were different in phase distribution. The microstructure observation
of sample B indicated that the part of the conventional casting-forging process
consisted of martensite and carbide particles, but the SLM process consisted of a
uniformly distributed elongated martensite structure. In the region of different
forming process, there was a transition region with a width of 40 lm. The transition
zone was relatively loose and the defects were relatively more. The microstructure of
conventional casting–forging process 1.2709 die steel samples was mainly composed
of lath martensite and carbide particles. In addition, the relative densities of the three
sets of samples were close to 100%. The impact toughness values aKV, aKU and the
impact absorbing energy KV2, KU2 of sample B, sample A and sample C showed an
increasing trend, and the mechanical property difference was less than 15%. It is
proved that the mechanical properties of 1.2709 die steel workpiece prepared by SLM
process can meet the needs of engineering application.
