Selective laser melting (SLM) enables the manufacture
of lattice structures with highly engineered mechanical
properties that are optimised for the associated
design requirements. Such lattice structures offer high
specific strength and stiffness characteristics allowing design
freedom beyond the capacity of solid materials.
However, to apply lattices as space filling structural elements,
it is necessary to quantify their mechanical properties
such as compressive strength and stiffness under
varying geometric conditions. This work provides an experimental
investigation of the manufacturability of SLM
Ti-6Al-4V lattice struts of varying diameter and inclination.
From this investigation, lattice structures are
manufactured for varying cell topology, cell size, number
of unit cells and associated boundary conditions. The deformation
and failure behaviour of these lattices is theoretically
predicted and experimentally validated. The convergence
of mechanical properties with increasing number
of unit cells, as well as the effect of lattice topology on
mechanical behaviour and observed failures mode are
reported.
