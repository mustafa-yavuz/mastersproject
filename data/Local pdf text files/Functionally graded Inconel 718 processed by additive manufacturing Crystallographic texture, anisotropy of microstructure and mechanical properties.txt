Additive manufacturing offers a unique way of anisotropic microstructure control with a high degree of design
freedom. This study demonstrates that application of suitable process parameters and laser sources in selective
laser melting may favour either one sharp single component texture, more uniformly distributed crystal orienta-
tion, or a combination of the above in a preferred gradient, which inﬂuence the mechanical properties. It is shown
that transitions in microstructure, texture, and properties in fabricated Inconel 718 functionally graded compo-
nents can be obtained at relatively small or large length scales, depending upon the functional gradient desired
in a particular application. Results obtained by electron backscatter diffraction showed distinct regions of coarse
elongated grains with a strong (001) orientation uniformly embedded in randomly distributed ﬁne grained ma-
trix. Mechanical tests in the form of hardness, tensile and in-situ digital image correlation tests showed steep
transitions in the developed Inconel gradients. The observed mechanical properties were found to be primarily
dependent on the grain size and texture and are superior to the cast samples for both laser sources. The devel-
oped process strategy can be further applied to design functional gradients with selected tailored properties
and to account for directional anisotropy of solidiﬁed components.
