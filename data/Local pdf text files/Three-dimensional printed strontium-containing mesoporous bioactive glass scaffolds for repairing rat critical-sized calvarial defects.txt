The development of a new generation of biomaterials with high osteogenic ability for fast osseointegra-
tion with host bone is being intensively investigated. In this study, we have fabricated three-dimensional
(3-D) strontium-containing mesoporous bioactive glass (Sr-MBG) scaffolds by a 3-D printing technique.
Sr-MBG scaffolds showed uniform interconnected macropores ((cid:2)400 lm), high porosity ((cid:2)70%) and
enhanced compressive strength (8.67 Â± 1.74 MPa). Using MBG scaffolds as a control, the biological prop-
erties of Sr-MBG scaffolds were evaluated by apatite-forming ability, adhesion, proliferation, alkaline
phosphatase activity and osteogenic gene expression of osteoblast-like cells MC3T3-E1. Furthermore,
Sr-MBG scaffolds were used to repair critical-sized rat calvarial defects. The results showed that
Sr-MBG scaffolds possessed good apatite-forming ability and stimulated MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation
and differentiation. Importantly, the in vivo results revealed that Sr-MBG scaffolds had good osteogenic
capability and stimulated new blood vessel formation in critical-sized rat calvarial defects within
8 weeks. Therefore, 3-D printed Sr-MBG scaffolds with favorable pore structure and high osteogenic
ability have more potential applications in bone regeneration.
