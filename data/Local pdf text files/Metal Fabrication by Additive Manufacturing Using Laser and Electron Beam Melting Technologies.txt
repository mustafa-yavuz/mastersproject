Selective laser melting (SLM) and electron beam melting (EBM) are relatively new rapid, additive manufacturing technologies which can allow for the fabrication of complex, multi-functional metal or alloy monoliths by CAD-directed, selective melting of precursor powder beds. By altering the beam parameters and scan strategies, new and unusual, even non-equilibrium microstructures can be produced; including controlled microstructural architectures which ideally extend the contemporary materials science and engineering paradigm relating structure-properties-processing-performance. In this study, comparative examples for SLM and EBM fabricated components from pre-alloyed, atomized precursor powders are presented. These include Cu, Ti– 6Al–4V, alloy 625 (a Ni-base superalloy), a Co-base superalloy, and 17-4 PH stainless steel. These systems are characterized by optical metallography, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction.
