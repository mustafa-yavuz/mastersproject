Selective laser melting (SLM) is a promising additive manufacturing technique that allows fabrication of
complex functional components via the selective layer-by-layer melting of powder bed particles using a
high-energy laser beam. This technique can allows the production of a wide range of novel high-
performance materials including metal matrix nanocomposites with unique microstructures and supe-
rior properties. In this study, the SLM process was used with various laser-scanning methods to fabricate
cylindrically shaped components from 316L stainless steel reinforced with 15 vol.% TiC nanoparticles. A
deep relationship between the SLM process and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the
resulting components was established to understand the inﬂuence of the selected scanning strategy on
the densiﬁcation, solidiﬁcation microstructure, texture, and anisotropy. It was found that the building
strategy has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the build densiﬁcation, with the highest densiﬁcation obtained
using a cross-hatched scanning strategy. The resulting bimodal grain structure was related to the heat
ﬂowing from the solidifying melt pool (i.e., the developed microstructure depends on the local heat
transfer conditions); the TiC content in the fabricated nanocomposite was also varied according to the
applied scanning method. The relatively strong crystallographic textures along the building and scanning
directions can be transformed into weak ones, and the mechanical properties of the produced compo-
nents can be made nearly isotropic by rotating the scanning vector inside or between the created layers
by 90(cid:1) (known as alternate and cross hatched scanning strategies, respectively) using a single pass of the
laser beam. The obtained results indicate that the utilized laser-scanning strategies allowed tailoring of
the densiﬁcation level, solidiﬁcation microstructure, crystallographic texture, and anisotropy of me-
chanical properties the fabricated parts. Hence, SLM can be successfully used for manufacturing 316L
stainless steel nanocomposite parts with a high degree of densiﬁcation and controllable texture.
