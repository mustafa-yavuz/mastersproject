This   study   evaluates   the   performance   of   continuous   carbon,   Kevlar   and   glass   ﬁbre   reinforced   composites
manufactured   using   the   fused   deposition   modelling   (FDM)   additive   manufacturing   technique.   The   ﬁbre
reinforced   nylon   composites   were   fabricated   using   a  Markforged   Mark   One   3D   printing   system.   The
mechanical   performance   of  the   composites   was   evaluated   both   in   tension   and   ﬂexure.   The   inﬂuence   of
ﬁbre   orientation,   ﬁbre   type   and   volume   fraction   on  mechanical   properties   were   also   investigated.   The
results   were   compared   with   that   of   both   non-reinforced   nylon   control   specimens,   and   known   material
property   values   from   literature.   It  was   demonstrated   that   of   the  ﬁbres   investigated,   those   fabricated   using
carbon   ﬁbre   yielded   the   largest   increase   in   mechanical   strength   per   ﬁbre   volume.   Its   tensile   strength
values   were   up   to  6.3   times   higher   than   those   obtained   with   the  non-reinforced   nylon   polymer.   As   the
carbon   and  glass   ﬁbre   volume   fraction   increased   so   too   did   the  level   of   air   inclusion   in  the   composite
matrix,   which   impacted   on  mechanical   performance.   As   a  result,   a  maximum   efﬁciency   in   tensile   strength
was   observed   in   glass   specimen   as  ﬁbre   content   approached   22.5%,   with   higher   ﬁbre   contents   (up   to  33%),
yielding   only   minor   increases   in   strength.
