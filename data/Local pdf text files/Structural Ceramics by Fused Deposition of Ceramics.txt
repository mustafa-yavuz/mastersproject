Fused Deposition of Ceramics (FDC) is a SFF technique, based on FDMTM technology, for fabrication of advanced structural ceramics from powderlbinder filaments. In this study, in-situ reinforced (ISR) Si3N4 powder and polymer/wax based binder systems were used as filament material for FDC processing using a commercially available FDMTM system, 3D Modeler. Powderlbinder feedstocks were mixed using a torque rheometer and filaments were fabricated using a capillary rheometer and twin screw extruder. Green FDC components were built from these filaments and then characterized for inter-road and inter-layer bonding. Binder removal procedures were established for FDC green components to yield brown parts without distortion or shape change. Brown FDC parts were characterized for carbon residue, pore distribution and dimensional changes. Brown FDC parts were then sintered and the sintered density, microstructure, and shrinkage anisotropy were studied.
