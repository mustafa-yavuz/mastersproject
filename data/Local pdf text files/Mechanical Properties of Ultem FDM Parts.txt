In this work the influence of the orientation and the toolpath generation of manufactured parts based on the mechanical data are analyzed. Tensile Specimen are generated with the given parameters as well as with changing parameters of the native software based upon the CAD data. The parts then are built up with the “Fortus 400mc” from Stratasys. First tensile tests show different strength and strain characteristics that depend on the given structure and as a result of the build direction. The influence of the parameters was analyzed with a statistic test method by using the software Design Expert.
