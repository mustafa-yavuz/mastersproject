Thirty years into its development, additive manufacturing
has become a mainstream manufacturing process.
Additive manufacturing build up parts by adding materials
one layer at a time based on a computerized 3D solid model.
It does not require the use of fixtures, cutting tools, coolants,
and other auxiliary resources. It allows design optimization
and the producing of customized parts on-demand. Its
advantages over conventional manufacturing have captivated
the imagination of the public, reflected in recent mainstream
publications that call additive manufacturing “the
third industrial revolution.” This paper reviews the societal
impact of additive manufacturing from a technical perspective.
Abundance of evidences were found to support the
promises of additive manufacturing in the following areas:
(1) customized healthcare products to improve population
health and quality of life, (2) reduced environmental impact
for manufacturing sustainability, and (3) simplified supply
chain to increase efficiency and responsiveness in demand
fulfillment. In the mean time, the review also identified the
need for further research in the areas of life-cycle energy
consumption evaluation and potential occupation hazard
assessment for additive manufacturing.
