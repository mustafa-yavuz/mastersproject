We present a fully functional material extrusion
printer for optically transparent glass. The printer is
comprised of scalable modular elements, able to
operate at the high temperatures required to process
glass from a molten state to an annealed product. We
demonstrate a process enabling the construction of 3D
parts as described by Computer Aided Design (CAD)
models. Processing parameters such as temperature,
which control glass viscosity, and flow rate, layer
height and feed rate, can thus be adjusted to tailor
printing to the desired component, its shape and its
properties. We explored, defined and hard‚Äêcoded
geometric constraints and coiling patterns as well as
the integration of various colors into the current
controllable process, contributing to a new design and
manufacturing space. We report on performed
characterization of the printed material executed to
determine their morphological, mechanical and optical
properties. Printed parts demonstrated strong adhesion
between layers and satisfying optical clarity.
Demonstration of this molten glass 3D printer and
fabricated objects demonstrates the production of
parts, which are highly repeatable, enable light
transmission, and resemble the visual and mechanical
performance of glass constructs that are conventionally
obtained. Utilizing the optical nature of glass, complex
caustic patterns were created by projecting light
through the printed objects. The 3D printed glass
objects described here can thus be extended to
implementations across scales and functional domains
including product and architectural design. This
research lies at the intersection of design, engineering,
science and art, representing a highly interdisciplinary
approach.
