Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the
most popular additive manufacturing technologies for
various engineering applications. FDM process has been
introduced commercially in early 1990s by Stratasys Inc.,
USA. The quality of FDM processed parts mainly depends
on careful selection of process variables. Thus, identification
of the FDM process parameters that significantly affect
the quality of FDM processed parts is important. In recent
years, researchers have explored a number of ways to improve
the mechanical properties and part quality using
various experimental design techniques and concepts. This
article aims to review the research carried out so far in
determining and optimizing the process parameters of the
FDM process. Several statistical designs of experiments
and optimization techniques used for the determination of
optimum process parameters have been examined. The
trends for future FDM research in this area are described.
