Processing parameter has an important effect on Selective Laser Melting (SLM) and Electron Beam Melting (EBM) processes. Defects are easily formed by deviating from optimized processing parameters. This study purposely fabricated Ti-6Al-4V specimens with defects by varying process parameters from the factory default settings in both SLM and EBM equipment. Specimen’s density was measured based on the Archimedes method for estimating porosity. Microscopy of specimen’s top surface were observed to compare melt pool and overlap. “Marginal Parameters” is identified to describe the processing parameters which are capable of fabricating specimens with certain porosity. As a result, a correlation between defect regularity and marginal parameters has been established. The effect of marginal parameters on the melt pool is discussed to explain defect formation
