0,3D gel-printing of zirconia ceramic parts,"3D gel-printing (3DGP) is a new printing method, which is based on a 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) gelation system to produce complex shape parts. In this study, the 3DGP process based on a water-based gelation system was used to prepare zirconia (ZrO2) ceramic parts. The water-based ZrO2 ceramic slurry with a solid volume fraction of 50 vol% was prepared and its rheological property was characterized. The surface roughness is Ra 8.90 µm on the printed green sample, and Ra 8.25 µm on the sample after sintered at 1520 °C for 2 h. The relative density, the Vickers hardness and the transverse rupture strength of the sintered sample are 97.6%, 14.4 GPa and 450 MPa, respectively.

1,3D Printed Glass Surface Finish and Bulk Properties as a Function of the Printing Process,"It is impossible to print glass directly from a melt, layer by layer. Glass is not only very sensitive to temperature gradients between different layers but also to the cooling process. To achieve a glass state the melt, has to be cooled rapidly to avoid crystallization of the material and then annealed to remove cooling induced stress. In 3D-printing of glass the objects are shaped at room temperature and then fired. The material properties of the final objects are crucially dependent on the frit size of the glass powder used during shaping, the chemical formula of the binder and the firing procedure. For frit sizes below 250 µm, we seem to find a constant volume of pores of less than 5%. Decreasing frit size leads to an increase in the number of pores which then leads to an increase of opacity. The two different binders, 2-hydroxyethyl cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt, generate very different porosities. The porosity of samples with 2-hydroxyethyl cellulose is similar to frit-only samples, whereas carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt creates a glass foam. The surface finish is determined by the material the glass comes into contact with during firing.",SLM or DMLS,0.66,0.53,0.595,Metal,0.54,0.37,0.455
2,3D printing of ceramics A review,"Along with extensive research on the three-dimensional (3D) printing of polymers and metals, 3D printing of ceramics is now the latest trend to come under the spotlight. The ability to fabricate ceramic components of arbitrarily complex shapes has been extremely challenging without 3D printing.This review focuses on the latest advances in the 3D printing of ceramics and presents the historical origins and evolution of each related technique.The main technical aspects,including feed stock properties,process control,post-treatments and energy source–material interactions,are also discussed.The technical challenges and advice about how to address these are presented. Comparisons are made between the techniques to facilitate the selection of the best ones in practical use. In addition, representative applications of the 3D printing of various types of ceramics are surveyed. Future directions are pointed out on the advancement on materials and forming mechanism for the fabrication of high-performance ceramic components.

3,3D Printing of Continuous-Fiber Composites by In-Nozzle Impregnation,"We have developed a method for the three-dimensional (3D) printing of continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastics based on fused-deposition modeling. The technique enables direct 3D fabrication without the use of molds and may become the standard next-generation composite fabrication methodology. A thermoplastic filament and continuous fibers were separately supplied to the 3D printer and the fibers were impregnated with the filament within the heated nozzle of the printer immediately before printing. Polylactic acid was used as the matrix while carbon fibers, or twisted yarns of natural jute fibers, were used as the reinforcements. The thermoplastics reinforced with unidirectional jute fibers were examples of plant-sourced composites; those reinforced with unidirectional carbon fiber showed mechanical properties superior to those of both the jute-reinforced and unreinforced thermoplastics. Continuous fiber reinforcement improved the tensile strength of the printed composites relative to the values shown by conventional 3D-printed polymer-based composites.

4,3D Printing of Transparent Glass,"Traditional assembly line manufacturing is speculative, costly and environmentally unsustainable. It is speculative because it commits substantial resources—energy, materials, shipping, handling, stocking and displaying—without a guaranteed sale. It is costly because each of these resources—material, process, people and place—involves expense not encountered when a product is manufactured at the time of sale. It is environmentally unsustainable because, no matter how much recycling is done, not using the resources unless actually needed is always a better path. As part of the RAGNAROK (Research on Advancing Glass & Nonorganic Applications to Recreate Objects & Kinetics) project in HP Labs, we identified glass as a promising candidate for additive manufacturing based on 3-D printing methods. Glass is a silica-based material. With 90% of the earth’s crust composed of silicate minerals, there will be no shortage of silica resources. Glass is easy to recycle and is environmentally friendly. Glass is inexpensive but looks precious, is pleasant to the touch and is so familiar that customers will not be disappointed by its fragility— under certain conditions.  A major need, and concomitantly a major challenge, for 3D printed glass is transparency.",SLM or DMLS,0.62,0.61,0.615,Metal,0.51,0.57,0.54
5,A Review of Additive Manufacturing,"Additive manufacturing processes take the information from a computer-aided design (CAD) ﬁle that is later converted to a stereolithography (STL) ﬁle. In this process, the drawing made in the CAD software is approximated by triangles and sliced containing the information of each layer that is going to be printed. There is a discussion of the relevant additive manufacturing processes and their applications. The aerospace industry employs them because of the possibility of manufacturing lighter structures to reduce weight. Additive manufacturing is transforming the practice of medicine and making work easier for architects. In 2004, the Society of Manufacturing Engineers did a classiﬁcation of the various technologies and there are at least four additional signiﬁcant technologies in 2012. Studies are reviewed which were about the strength of products made in additive manufacturing processes. However, there is still a lot of work and research to be accomplished before additive manufacturing technologies become standard in the manufacturing industry because not every commonly used manufacturing material can be handled.The accuracy needs improvement to eliminate the necessity of a ﬁnishing process.The continuous and increasing growth experienced since the early days and the successful results up to the present time allow for optimism that additive manufacturing has a signiﬁcant place in the future of manufacturing.

6,Additive manufacturing and its societal impact a literature review,"Thirty years into its development, additive manufacturing
has become a mainstream manufacturing process.
Additive manufacturing build up parts by adding materials
one layer at a time based on a computerized 3D solid model.
It does not require the use of fixtures, cutting tools, coolants,
and other auxiliary resources. It allows design optimization
and the producing of customized parts on-demand. Its
advantages over conventional manufacturing have captivated
the imagination of the public, reflected in recent mainstream
publications that call additive manufacturing “the
third industrial revolution.” This paper reviews the societal
impact of additive manufacturing from a technical perspective.
Abundance of evidences were found to support the
promises of additive manufacturing in the following areas:
(1) customized healthcare products to improve population
health and quality of life, (2) reduced environmental impact
for manufacturing sustainability, and (3) simplified supply
chain to increase efficiency and responsiveness in demand
fulfillment. In the mean time, the review also identified the
need for further research in the areas of life-cycle energy
consumption evaluation and potential occupation hazard

7,Additive manufacturing and mechanical characterization of high density fully stabilized zirconia,"Mechanical properties of additively manufactured 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) parts were extensively studied for the ﬁrst time. A novel freeform extrusion fabrication process, called Ceramic OnDemand Extrusion (CODE), was employed to deposit an aqueous viscous suspension (~50 vol% solids loading) of fully stabilized zirconia powder in a layer-by-layer fashion. Each layer was exposed to infrared radiation after deposition to attain partial solidiﬁcation due to drying. Before exposure, the layer was surrounded by oil to preclude non-uniform evaporation, which could cause warpage and crack formation. After the fabrication process was completed, the parts were humid-dried in an environmental chamber and densiﬁed by sintering under atmospheric pressure. Standard test methods were employed to examine the properties of sintered parts including density, Vickers hardness, fracture toughness, Young's modulus, and ﬂexural strength. Microstructural evaluation was also performed to observe the microstructural morphology and measure grain size. The results indicate that the properties of 8YSZ parts produced by the CODE process match those obtained by conventional fabrication techniques",FDM or FFF or EAM,0.58,0.42,0.5,Polymer,0.48,0.3,0.39
8,Additive manufacturing of carbonfiber-reinforced plastic compositesusing fused deposition modeling Effects of process parameterson tensile properties,"Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites have been intensively used for many applications due to their attractive
properties. The increasing demand of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites is driving novel manufacturing processes
to be in short manufacturing cycle time and low production cost, which is difficult to realize during carbon fiberreinforced
plastic composites fabrication in common molding processes. Fused deposition modeling, as one of the
additive manufacturing techniques, has been reported for fabricating carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites. The
process parameters used in fused deposition modeling of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites follow those in fused
deposition modeling of pure plastic materials. After adding fiber reinforcements, it is crucial to investigate proper fused
deposition modeling process parameters to ensure the quality of the carbon fiber-reinforced plastic parts fabricated by
fused deposition modeling. However, there are no reported investigations on the effects of fused deposition modeling
process parameters on the mechanical properties of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites. In the experimental
investigations of this paper, carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composite parts are fabricated using a fused deposition
modeling machine. Tensile tests are conducted to obtain the tensile properties. The effects of fused deposition modeling
process parameters on the tensile properties of fused deposition modeling-fabricated carbon fiber-reinforced plastic
composite parts are investigated. The fracture interfaces of the parts after tensile testing are observed by a scanning
electron microscope to explain material failure modes and reasons.",SLM or DMLS,0.67,0.75,0.71,Metal,0.63,0.56,0.595
9,Additive Manufacturing of Ceramic Based Materials,"This paper offers a review of present achievements in the field of processing of ceramic based materials with complex geometry using the main additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. In AM, the geometrical design of a desired ceramic-based component is combined with the materials design.In this way,the fabrication times and the product costs of ceramic-based parts with required properties can be substantially reduced. However, dimensional accuracy and surface finish still remain crucial features intoday’s AM due to the layer-by-layer formation of the parts.In spite of the fact that significant progress has been made in the development of feedstock materials, the most difficult limitations for AM technologies are the restrictions set by material selection for each AM method and aspects considering the inner architectural design of the manufactured parts. Hence, any future progress in the field of AM should be based on the improvement of the existing technologies or, alternatively, the development of new approaches with an emphasis on parts allowing the near-net formation of ceramic structures,while optimizing the design of new materials and of the part architecture.

10,"Additive manufacturing of ceramics issues, potentialities, and opportunites","Additive manufacturing (AM) is a technology which has the potential not only to change the way of conventional industrial manufacturing processes, adding material instead of subtracting, but also to create entirely new production and business strategies. Since about three decades, AM technologies have been used to fabricate prototypes or models mostly from polymeric or metallic materials. Recently, products have been introduced into the market that cannot be produced in another way than additively. Ceramic materials are, however, not easy to process by AM technologies, as their processing requirements (in terms of feedstock and/or sintering) are very challenging. On the other hand, it can be expected that AM technologies, once successful, will have an extraordinary impact on the industrial production of ceramic components and, moreover, will open for ceramics new uses and new market",FDM or FFF or EAM,0.59,0.67,0.63,Metal,0.41,0.65,0.53
11,Additive Manufacturing of Dense Ceramic Parts via Direct Ink Writing of Aqueous Alumina Suspensions,"Additive manufacturing of near-net-shaped dense ceramic components has been established via room-temperature direct writing of highly loaded aqueous alumina suspensions in a layer-by-layer fashion. The effect of alumina solid loading on rheology, specimen uniformity, density, microstructure, and mechanical properties was studied. All suspensions contained a polymer binder (~5 vol.%), dispersant, and 51–58 vol.% alumina powder. Rheological measurements indicated all suspensions to be yield-pseuodoplastic, and both yield stress and viscosity were found to increase with increasing alumina solid loading. Shear rates ranging from 19.5 to 24.2/s, corresponding to viscosities of 9.8 to 17.2 Pas, for the 53–56 vol.% alumina suspensions were found to produce the best results for the 1.25-mm tip employed during writing. All parts were sintered to >98% of true density, with grain sizes ranging from 3.2 to 3.7 lm. The average ﬂexure strength, which ranged from 134 to 157 MPa, was not inﬂuenced by the alumina solid loading.

12,Additive Manufacturing of Glass,"Selective laser melting (SLM) is a technique for the additive manufacturing (AM) of metals, plastics, and even ceramics. This paper explores using SLM for depositing glass structures. A CO2 laser is used to locally melt portions of a powder bed to study the effects of process parameters on stationary particle formation as well as continuous line quality. Numerical modeling is also applied to gain insight into the physical process. The experimental and numerical results indicate that the absorptivity of the glass powder is nearly constant with respect to the processing parameters. These results are used to deposit layered single-track wide walls to demonstrate the potential of using the SLM process for building transparent parts. Finally, the powder bed process is compared to a wire-fed approach. AM of glass is relevant for gradient index optics, systems with embedded optics, and the formation of hermetic seals",SLM or DMLS,0.52,0.84,0.6799999999999999,Metal,0.52,0.55,0.535
13,Additive Manufacturing of Optically Transparent Glass,"We present a fully functional material extrusion
printer for optically transparent glass. The printer is
comprised of scalable modular elements, able to
operate at the high temperatures required to process
glass from a molten state to an annealed product. We
demonstrate a process enabling the construction of 3D
parts as described by Computer Aided Design (CAD)
models. Processing parameters such as temperature,
which control glass viscosity, and flow rate, layer
height and feed rate, can thus be adjusted to tailor
printing to the desired component, its shape and its
properties. We explored, defined and hard‐coded
geometric constraints and coiling patterns as well as
the integration of various colors into the current
controllable process, contributing to a new design and
manufacturing space. We report on performed
characterization of the printed material executed to
determine their morphological, mechanical and optical
properties. Printed parts demonstrated strong adhesion
between layers and satisfying optical clarity.
Demonstration of this molten glass 3D printer and
fabricated objects demonstrates the production of
parts, which are highly repeatable, enable light
transmission, and resemble the visual and mechanical
performance of glass constructs that are conventionally
obtained. Utilizing the optical nature of glass, complex
caustic patterns were created by projecting light
through the printed objects. The 3D printed glass
objects described here can thus be extended to
implementations across scales and functional domains
including product and architectural design. This
research lies at the intersection of design, engineering,
science and art, representing a highly interdisciplinary

14,An experimental demonstration of effective Curved Layer Fused Filament Fabrication utilising a parallel deposition robot,"Fused   Filament   Fabrication   (FFF)   is   an   additive   manufacturing   (AM)   method   that   relies   on  the  thermal
extrusion   of   a  thermoplastic   feedstock   from   a  mobile   deposition   head.   Conventional   FFF   constructs   com-
ponents   from   stacks   of   individual   extruded   layers   using   tool   paths   with   ﬁxed   z-values   in   each   individual
layer.   Consequently,   the   manufactured   components   often   contain   inherent   weaknesses   in  the   z-axis   due
to  the  relatively   weak   thermal   fusion   bonding   that   occurs   between   individual   layers,   as  well   as   poor   sur-
face  ﬁnish   in   shallow   sloped   contours.   This   study   demonstrates   the   use   of   Curved   Layer   FFF   (CLFFF)   tool
paths   in   tandem   with   a  commercially   available   parallel,   or   delta,  style   FFF  system   to  allow   the  deposition
head   to   follow   the   topology   of  the   component.   By   incorporating   a   delta   robot   and   CLFFF   tool   paths   in  this
way,   improvements   in   the   surface   ﬁnish   of  the   manufactured   parts   has   been   observed,   and   time   costs
associated   with   Cartesian   robot   based   CLFFF   manufacturing   have   been   notably   reduced.   Furthermore,
employing   a  delta   robot   provides   additional   ﬂexibility   to   CLFFF   manufacturing   and   increases   the   feasi-
bility   of  its   application   for   advanced   manufacturing.   The   study   has   also   demonstrated   a  viable   approach
to   multi-material   FFF   by   decoupling   support   structure   and   part   manufacture   into   regions   of  CLFFF   and

15,Anisotropic material properties of fused deposition modeling ABS,"Rapid Prototyping (RP) technologies provide the ability to fabricate initial prototypes from various model materials. Stratasys Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a typical RP process that can fabricate prototypes out of ABS plastic. To predict the mechanical behavior of FDM parts, it is critical to understand the material properties of the raw FDM process material, and the effect that FDM build parameters have on anisotropic material properties. This paper characterizes the properties of ABS parts fabricated by the FDM 1650. Using a Design of Experiment (DOE) approach, the process parameters of FDM, such as raster orientation, air gap, bead width, color, and model temperature were examined. Tensile strengths and compressive strengths of directionally fabricated specimens were measured and compared with injection molded FDM ABS P400 material. For the FDM parts made with a 0.003 inch overlap between roads, the typical tensile strength ranged between 65 and 72 percent of the strength of injection molded ABS P400. The compressive strength ranged from 80 to 90 percent of the injection molded FDM ABS.

16,Anisotropic Mechanical Behavior of AlSi10Mg Parts Produced by Selective Laser Melting,"AlSi 10Mg cylinders produced by laser powder-bed fusion have somewhat different yield behavior for cylinders with XY orientation and Z orientation. Earlier yielding for Z-oriented samples is likely related to micro-residual stress, resulting from the difference in thermal expansion of the aluminum matrix and cellular silicon. Smaller tensile reduction in area of Z-oriented samples is related to tearing along the softer region at the boundaries of melt pools, where the silicon cell spacing is larger. Indentation measurements conﬁrmed the lower hardness at the edges of melt pools.

18,Assessing the Structural Integrity of Additive Manufactured Metal Parts with X-ray CT,"This paper presents a study of structural integrity assessment of the internal features of  additive manufactured (AM) metal parts using X-ray computed tomography (CT). Recent work [1]–[3] has shown the significant progression of CT technology as a tool for assesing AM processes since earlier conferences/workshops [4]. While previous work [5] provided some insight for evaluation of dimensional measurements of AM parts made of plastics, this work focuses on both internal structures and metrology of AM metal parts. The prototype parts analyzed in the present work were manufactured by laser-based powder bed fusion (LPBF) as well as electron-beam melting (EBM). Figure 1 shows both optical and 3D CAD volume images of an AM compressor wheel. This part was manufactured using Al-Si10Mg pre-alloyed powders and the LPBF technique. Specific process parameters include a layer thickness of 30 µm, hatch spacing of about 100-150 µm, average beam velocity of about 2000 mm/s, power of 90-100% of full power (400W) and a preheating temperature of 200°C using typical laser machine processing parameters. The computer-aided design (CAD) model details the internal structures. Although the hollow internal structures shown in Figure 1 are not typically part of conventionally processed versions of this compressor wheel design, the cavity paths (i.e. with diameters of 0.8 mm and 0.5 mm) were deliberately added in the CAD model in order to demonstrate the integration of AM and CT in the present study. The second part, a cooling water manifold, was made using Ti-6Al4V pre-alloyed powders and the EBM technique. In particular, process parameters included sequential build layer thickness of 50 µm and a preheat temperature of around 750°C along with typical EBM machine processing parameters. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show optical and CT images of the EBM-AM Ti-6Al-4V cooling water manifold to illustrate both AM and CT capabilities in this complex design. CT scans were acquired by a metrological CT system, the Nikon’s MCT 225, which has a maximum permissible error (MPE) equal to (9+L/50) μm (where L is length in mm) [6], in accordance with the VDI/VDE 2630 guidelines [7] .

19,Binding Mechanisms in Selective Laser Sintering and Selective Laser Melting,"Layer Manufacturing (LM) technologies like Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) were developed in the late 80’s as techniques for Rapid Prototyping (RP). Today, SLS - as well as its derived technology Selective Laser Melting (SLM) - is used as well for prototyping, tooling and manufacturing purposes. This widening of applications is caused mainly by the possibility to process a large variety of materials, resulting in a broad range of physical and m echanical properties.  This paper presents a survey of the various binding mechanisms in SLS and SLM, which are responsible for the broad range of materials and applications. Basic binding mechanisms involve solid state sintering, chemically induced binding, liquid phase sintering, partial melting and full melting. Many subcategories can be distinguished based on the type of structural or binder powder composition: single component powder grains (single material or alloy), composite powder grains, mixtures of different powder grains, distinct binder material (sacrificial or permanent), etc. The paper will explain how these binding mechanisms apply for sintering various types of materials: plastics, metal, ceramics and composites (e.g. glass reinforced polymers, cermets, hardmetals, etc.).

Micro computer tomography (lCT) analysis demonstrated the capability to fabricate three-dimensional structures with an interconnected
porosity and pore sizes suitable for tissue ingrowth and vascularization. Mechanical properties, such as compressive strength
and elastic modulus, of the tested structures were similar to those of human bone. Thus, stress-shielding effects after implantation might
be avoided due to a reduced stiffness mismatch between implant and bone. A chemical surface modification using HCl and NaOH
induced apatite formation during in vitro bioactivity tests in simulated body fluid under dynamic conditions. The modified bioactive

Spatially indexed stress-free cubes were obtained by electrical discharge machining (EDM) equivalent prisms of similar shape. The (311) interplanar spacings from the EDM sectioned sample were compared to the interplanar spacings calculated to fulfill stress and moment balance. We have shown that applying stress and moment balance is a necessary supplement to the measurements for the stress-free cubes with respect to accurate stress calculations in additively manufactured components.

26,Defect Morphology of Ti-6Al-4V Parts Fabricated by Selective Laser Melting and Electron Beam Melting,"In order to investigate the morphology of defects present in Selective Laser Melting (SLM) and Electron Beam Melting (EBM) processes, Ti-6Al-4V specimens were fabricated with varying porosity using non-optimum processing parameters. Defective specimens were sectioned and polished for microscopy. Image processing was adopted for statistically analyzing the characteristics of defects, such as distribution of defect area and dimensional proportion of each defect. It is found that defect morphology is influenced by process parameters as a result of a variation in the melt pool. Image processing of a cross-section could be a feasible way for calculating porosity of specimens. ",FDM or FFF or EAM,0.58,0.57,0.575,Ceramic,0.45,0.42,0.435
27,Deformation and failure behaviour of Ti-6Al-4V lattice structures manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM),"Selective laser melting (SLM) enables the manufacture
of lattice structures with highly engineered mechanical
properties that are optimised for the associated
design requirements. Such lattice structures offer high
specific strength and stiffness characteristics allowing design
freedom beyond the capacity of solid materials.
However, to apply lattices as space filling structural elements,
it is necessary to quantify their mechanical properties
such as compressive strength and stiffness under
varying geometric conditions. This work provides an experimental
investigation of the manufacturability of SLM
Ti-6Al-4V lattice struts of varying diameter and inclination.
From this investigation, lattice structures are
manufactured for varying cell topology, cell size, number
of unit cells and associated boundary conditions. The deformation
and failure behaviour of these lattices is theoretically
predicted and experimentally validated. The convergence
of mechanical properties with increasing number
of unit cells, as well as the effect of lattice topology on

28,DESIGN AND TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION FOR ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED STRUCTURAL PARTS A FORMULA STUDENT CASE STUDY,"Formula Student is a worldwide project for engineering students to design, build and race a small single seater racing car. The teams have to cope with rules and restrictions which concern specifications of the car such frame, engine and safety. Motorsport sector demands lightweight vehicle concepts without sacrificing performance. In that direction, high stiffness to-weight ratio must be accomplished to almost every component of the car. Consequently, the design for manufacturing is crucial to Formula Student teams. Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a technology that can effectively meet the requirements for reduced weight and high stiffness components, in contrast with convectional manufacturing processes such as milling or turning. In this work, the main guidelines for designing an Additively Manufactured part are presented and optimization techniques using ANSA and Tosca software tools are analyzed, in order to propose a redesign for a structural part of a Formula Student racecar based on AM. The AM process advantages and the flexibility offered in designing and manufacturing of complex components lead to a lighter structural part, achieving equivalent stiffness validated following extensive FEA analysis. Finally, this work tries to overcome implications of current CAD programs that are considered inadequate for designing for AM and explore the design freedoms of AM in order to get the most out of it",FDM or FFF or EAM,0.57,0.49,0.53,Metal,0.43,0.38,0.405

30,"Direct Metal Laser Sintering, an additive manufacturing technology ready to produce lightweight structural parts for robotic applications","Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technology for the fabrication of near netshaped parts directly from computer-aided design (CAD) data by melting together different layers with the help of a laser source. Its application for manufacturing three- dimensional objects represents one of the promising directions to solve challenging industrial problems. This approach permits to extend significantly the freedom of design and manufacture by allowing, for example, to create an object with desired shape and internal structure in a single fabrication step. The design of the part can be tailored to meet specific functions and properties (e.g. physical, mechanical, chemical, biological, etc.) using different materials. In this paper a DMLS machine was used for robotic lightweight components fabrication in an aluminium alloy. It was observed that DMLS technology not only achieved very interesting mechanical properties thanks to the very fine microstructure, but also can easily promote the development and study of lightweight lattice structures. In addition, it is envisaged to develop new custom materials, such as light metal matrix composites, suitable for the DMLS process, broadening the range of applications in different fields like space, aviation, automotive and other industries",SLM or DMLS,0.59,0.64,0.615,Metal,0.47,0.43,0.44999999999999996
31,Ductility of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy produced by selective laser melting of prealloyed powders,"Purpose – The aim of the paper is the study of the change in the mechanical properties (and in particular in ductility), with the microstructure, of a
biomedical Ti-6Al-4V alloy produced by different variants of selective laser melting (SLM).
Design/methodology/approach – Ti-6Al-4V alloy produced by different variants of SLM has been mechanically characterized through tensile testing.
Its microstructure has been investigated by optical observation after etching and by X-ray diffraction analysis.
Findings – SLM applied to Ti-6Al-4V alloy produces a material with a martensitic microstructure. Some microcracks, due the effect of incomplete
homologous wetting and residual stresses produced by the large solidification undercooling of the melt pool, are observable in the matrix. Owing to the
microstructure, the tensile strength of the additive manufactured parts is higher than the strength of hot worked parts, whereas the ductility is lower.
A pre-heating of the powder bed is effective in assisting remelting and reducing residual stresses, but ductility does not increase significantly, since the
microstructure remains martensitic. A post-building heat treatment causes the transformation of the metastable martensite in a biphasic a-b matrix,
with a morphology that depends on the heat treatment. This results in an increase in ductility and a reduction in strength values.
Originality/value – The study evidenced how it is possible to obtain a fully dense material and make the martensite transform in Ti-6Al-4V alloy
through the variation of the SLM process. The stabilization of the microstructure also results in an improvement of the ductility.",FDM or FFF or EAM,0.52,0.68,0.6000000000000001,Polymer,0.53,0.53,0.53

duplex stainless steel UNS S31803 processed by selective laser melting (SLM) are
conducted. The findings shed light on the phase arrangement evolving in the as-built
condition and in several heat-treated conditions. In the as-built condition, austenite
formation is almost suppressed due to process-related high cooling rates. Therefore, several
heat treatments ranging from 900 °C to 1200 °C for 5 min each were performed in order to
adjust to the desired austenitic-ferritic microstructure. Results generated by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) reveal a high dislocation density induced during SLM
fabrication, such that a recrystallized microstructure prevails after the heat treatment. Tensile
tests display the severe impact of the heat treatment on the resulting mechanical response.
The nearly complete ferritic as-built specimens obtain a higher ultimate tensile strength and
a reduced elongation at fracture compared to the heat-treated specimens.",SLM or DMLS,0.62,0.59,0.605,Metal,0.42,0.61,0.515
33,Effect of annealing procedure on the bonding of ceramic to cobalt-chromium alloys fabricated by rapid prototypin,"An annealing procedure is a heat treatment process to improve the mechanical properties of cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloys. However, information is lacking about the effect of the annealing process on the bonding ability of ceramic to Co-Cr alloys fabricated by rapid prototyping. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of the fabrication techniques and the annealing procedure on the shear bond strength of ceramic to Co-Cr alloys fabricated by different techniques. Ninety-six cylindrical specimens (10-mm diameter, 10-mm height) made of Co-Cr alloywere prepared by casting(C), milling (M),direct process powder-bed (LaserCUSING) with and without annealing (CL+, CL), and direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) with annealing (EL+) and without annealing (EL). After the application of ceramic to the metal specimens, the metal-ceramic bond strength was assessed using a shear force test at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Shear bond strength values were statistically analyzed by 1-way ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison tests (a=.05). Although statistically signiﬁcant differences were found among the 3 groups (M, 29.87 ±2.06; EL, 38.92 ±2.04; and CL+, 40.93 ±2.21; P=.002), no signiﬁcant differences were found among the others (P>.05). The debonding surfaces of all specimens exhibited mixed failure mode.These results showed that the direct process powder-bed method is promising in terms of metal-ceramic bonding ability.

This study investigates how defects affect the fatigue performance of Ti-6Al-4V samples in an SLM as-built surface finish condition. Fatigue samples were built and heat treated for stress relief. In order to investigate the effect of defects, a series of fatigue samples were designed with built-in cylindrical and double-conical defects.

Several open-source and low cost AM machines, known as 3D Printers, have recently been developed using thermoplastic extrusion process based on the original FDM technology.  Many of these 3D Printers use Polylactic Acid (PLA) plastic for building parts. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the tensile properties of the PLA thermoplastic material processed by the Cube-2 3D Printer.  In this study, the dog-bone sized PLA specimens are printed in different build orientations and a Zwick Z010 tensile testing machine is used to determine the tensile properties of PLA in different build orientation",SLM or DMLS,0.51,0.41,0.45999999999999996,Ceramic,0.53,0.37,0.45

Although ASTM/ISO standards exist for determining the orientation dependence of various mechanical properties in both cast and wrought materials, these standards are evolving for materials produced via additive manufacturing (AM) techniques. The current work was conducted as part of a larger America Makes funded project to begin to examine the effects of process variables on the microstructure and fracture and fatigue behavior of AM Ti-6Al-4V. In the fatigue crack growth tests, the fatigue threshold, Paris law slope, and overload toughness were determined at different load ratios, R, whereas fatigue precracked samples were tested to determine the fracture toughness. The as-deposited material exhibited a ﬁne-scale basket-weave microstructure throughout the build, and although fracture surface examination revealed the presence of unmelted powders, disbonded regions, and isolated porosity, the resulting mechanical properties were in the range of those reported for cast and wrought Ti-6Al-4V.

37,Evaluations of cellular lattice structures manufactured using selective laser melting,"Metallic additive manufacturing techniques, in particular the selective laser melting (SLM) process, are capable of fabricating strong, lightweight and complex metallic lattice structures. However, they still face certain process limitations such as geometrical constraints and in some cases the need for support structures. This study evaluates the manufacturability and performance of SLM produced periodic cellular lattice structures, which are designed by repeating a unit cell type called gyroid consisting of circular struts and a spherical core. The effect of unit cell size on the manufacturability, density and compression properties of the manufactured cellular lattice structures were investigated. Microcomputer tomography (CT) scan results reveal that the gyroid cellular lattice structures with various unit cell sizes ranging from 2 to 8 mm can be manufactured free of defects by the SLM process without the need of additional support structures. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs show that the lattice structures made by SLM have a good geometric agreement with the original computeraided design (CAD) models, but many partially melted metal particles are bonded to strut surfaces. The struts within the gyroid cellular lattice structures with smaller unit cell sizes have higher densities due to their shorter scan vector lengths in the SLM process. The yield strength and Young’s modulus of the Gyroid cellular lattice structures increase with the decrease in the unit cell size due to the denser struts of the lattice structures with smaller unit cell sizes.

manufactured using a direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) technique. Neutron diffraction was
used to profile the residual stresses in the samples before and after removal of the build plate and
support structures. Moreover, distortion level of the parts before and after the removal was
quantified using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). Large tensile in-plane stresses (up to ≈
400 MPa) were measured near the as-built disk top surfaces, where the stress magnitude
decreased from the disk center to the edges. The stress gradient was steeper for the disks with
smaller diameters and heights. Following the removal of the build plate and support structures,
the magnitude of the in-plane residual stresses decreased dramatically (up to 330 MPa) whereas
the axial stress magnitude did not change significantly. The stress relaxation caused the disks to
distort, where the distortion metric was higher for the disks with smaller diameters and heights.
The distribution of the residual stresses revealed a marked breakdown of self-similarity in their
distribution even comparing disk-shaped samples that were fabricated under identical printing
parameters; the stress field profiles were not linearly scaled as a function of height and diameter.",SLM or DMLS,0.52,0.56,0.54,Metal,0.43,0.43,0.43

The XRD pattern indicated that the crystalline phase of the parts was the t-ZrO2 phase, while SEM characterization revealed that the sintered bodies were composed of densely packed submicron-grade grains, without any discernible pores. The density of the parts was measured as 97.14% via Archimedes’ water displacement method, which is consistent with the results of SEM characterization. Additionally, the measured Vickers hardness and fracture toughness of the fabricated parts were 13.0597 GPa and 6.0380 MPa m1/2, respectively. These values are close to the structural properties of common zirconia ceramics prepared by conventional approaches. Hence, a novel DLP-stereolithography-based 3D printing process for the fabrication of complex and dense zirconia ceramic parts has been proposed in this work.

40,Finite element modeling of the compressive response of lattice structures manufactured using the selective laser melting technique,"Previous work on lightweight energy-absorbing truss based structures has highlighted the potential of SLM-built lattices. Finite element models have been developed to predict the compressive response of lattice structures based on two simple architectures—a body-centred cubic structure (BCC) and a similar structure with vertical pillars (BCC-Z). Both 3D continuum and beam elements have been used to model the structures under quasi-static compressive loads. Key difﬁculties in modelling the lattice structures have been highlighted and possible solutions have been offered. The results from the FE models are compared to experimental data and have been shown to agree well. The collapse modes predicted by the FE models were also in agreement with the experimental observations. The stress distribution within the BCC unit cells at increasing levels of crush has been identiﬁed and shows the formation of plastic hinges in the struts near to the nodal regions. In the latter stages of this investigation, the unit cell geometry was modiﬁed in order to enhance the stiffness and yield stress under compressive loading conditions. Predictions made using both analytical and beam element FE models demonstrate that the stiffness and yield strength could be improved by varying the unit cell geometry. Further tests were carried out on modiﬁed lattice structures to verify the predictions. ",FDM or FFF or EAM,0.52,0.63,0.575,Polymer,0.49,0.52,0.505

freedom. This study demonstrates that application of suitable process parameters and laser sources in selective
laser melting may favour either one sharp single component texture, more uniformly distributed crystal orienta-
tion, or a combination of the above in a preferred gradient, which inﬂuence the mechanical properties. It is shown
that transitions in microstructure, texture, and properties in fabricated Inconel 718 functionally graded compo-
nents can be obtained at relatively small or large length scales, depending upon the functional gradient desired
in a particular application. Results obtained by electron backscatter diffraction showed distinct regions of coarse
elongated grains with a strong (001) orientation uniformly embedded in randomly distributed ﬁne grained ma-
trix. Mechanical tests in the form of hardness, tensile and in-situ digital image correlation tests showed steep
transitions in the developed Inconel gradients. The observed mechanical properties were found to be primarily
dependent on the grain size and texture and are superior to the cast samples for both laser sources. The devel-
oped process strategy can be further applied to design functional gradients with selected tailored properties

the functional relationship between process parameters and
tensile strength for the fused deposition modelling (FDM)
process using the group method for data modelling for prediction
purposes. An initial test was carried out to determine
whether part orientation and raster angle variations affect the
tensile strength. It was found that both process parameters
affect tensile strength response. Further experimentations
were carried out in which the process parameters considered
were part orientation, raster angle, raster width and air gap.
The process parameters and the experimental results were
submitted to the group method of data handling (GMDH),
resulting in predicted output, in which the predicted output
values were found to correlate very closely with the measured
values. Using differential evolution (DE), optimal process
parameters have been found to achieve good strength simultaneously
for the response. The mathematical model of the
response of the tensile strength with respect to the process
parameters comprising part orientation, raster angle, raster
width and air gap has been developed based on GMDH, and
it has been found that the functionality of the additive

Although this technique has been mainly used for rapid prototyping, interest is growing in direct manufacture of actual parts. For wide spread application of 3D additive manufacturing, both techniques and feedstock materials require improvements to meet the mechanical requirements of load-bearing components. Here, we investigated short ﬁber (0.2–0.4 mm) reinforced acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene composites as a feedstock for 3D-printing in terms of their processibility, microstructure and mechanical performance. The additive components are also compared with traditional compression molded composites. The tensile strength and modulus of 3D-printed samples increased 115% and 700%, respectively. 3D-printing yielded samples with very high ﬁber orientation in the printing direction (up to 91.5%), whereas, compression molding process yielded samples with signiﬁcantly lower ﬁber orientation. Microstructure–mechanical property relationships revealed that although a relatively high porosity is observed in 3D-printed composites as compared to those produced by the conventional compression molding technique, they both exhibited comparable tensile strength and modulus. This phenomenon is explained based on the changes in ﬁber orientation, dispersion and void formation. ",SLM or DMLS,0.61,0.6,0.605,Ceramic,0.45,0.5,0.475

It was observed that the ﬁne component of bimodal ceramic powders, while uniformly distributed in the original powderbed, was preferentially found at the surface of the printed line, while the interior of the line was denuded of ﬁnes. Microscopic examination and approximate quantitative analysis supports the assertion that essentially all the ﬁnes have moved to the surface of the line. The mechanism for this rearrangement is not known, but is speculated to be related to the relative difﬁculty of wetting ﬁne powders.

solidification of metal powder particles in a track-by-track

investigation focuses on understanding the effect of
laser power and scan speed on the evolution of melt pool,

pool shape and size and porosity were evaluated. When a
low energy density was applied the un-melted powder
particles produced irregularly shaped porosity, and a high
energy density resulted in rounded porosity, which was due
to keyhole effects. The samples produced with a proper
combination of power and speeds were fully dense. Further,

The inﬂuence of the re-melting behavior and scan strategy on the formation of the ‘‘track-track” and
‘‘layer-layer” molten pool boundaries (MPBs), dimensional accuracy, microstructure feature, tensile

studied.
It showed that the defects, such as the part distortion, delamination and cracks, were
signiﬁcantly eliminated with the deformation rate less than 1%. The microstructure of a homogeneous
distribution of the Si phase, no apparent grain orientation on both sides of the MPBs, was produced in
the as-fabricated part, promoting the efﬁcient transition of the load stress. Cracks preferentially initiate
at the ‘‘track-track” MPBs when the tensile stress increases to a certain value, resulting in the formation of
the cleavage steps along the tensile loading direction. The cracks propagate along the ‘‘layer-layer” MPBs,
generating the ﬁne dimples. The mechanical behavior of the SLM-processed AlSi12 parts can be

Design/methodology/approach – The scan surface quality and mechanical properties of three different particle size distributions and two layer
thicknesses of 30 and 45mm were compared. The scan velocities for the different powder types have been adjusted in order to guarantee a part
density $ 99.5 per cent.
Findings – By using an optimised powder material, a low surface roughness can be obtained. A subsequent blasting process can further improve the
surface roughness for all powder materials used in this study, although this does not change the ranking of the powders with respect to the resulting
surface quality. Furthermore, optimised powder granulations lead generally to improved mechanical properties.
Practical implications – The results of this study indicate that the particle size distribution influences the quality of AM metallic parts, produced by
SLM. Therefore, it is recommended that any standardisation initiative like ASTM F42 should develop guidelines for powder materials for AM processes.
Furthermore, during production, the granulation changes due to spatters. Appropriate quality systems have to be developed.
Originality/value – The paper clearly shows that the particle size distribution plays an important role regarding density, surface quality and resulting
mechanical properties.",FDM or FFF or EAM,0.65,0.67,0.66,Metal,0.43,0.59,0.51

After varying sintering temperatures (1050–1300C) and times (1–10 h), it was found that sintering at 1300C for 3 h gave the greatest ﬂexural modulus and strength, 34.10 GPa and 76.82 MPa respectively.This was associated with a decrease in porosity and increase in densiﬁcation ability of the composite resulting from liquid phase sintering. Bioactivity tested by soaking in simulated body ﬂuid (SBF) and In Vitro toxicity studies showed that 3DP hydroxyapatite/A–W glass ceramic composite was non-toxic and bioactive.

The motivation for this research is the systematic investigation of the elastic and plastic deformation of TiAl6V4 at different strain rates. To investigate the inﬂuence of the strain rate on the mechanical response (e.g., energy absorption) of TiAl6V4 structures, compression tests on TiAl6V4-lattice structures with different strain rates are carried out to determine the mechanical response from the resulting stress-strain curves. Results are compared to the mechanical response of stainless steel lattice structures (316L). It is shown that heat-treated TiAl6V4 specimens have a larger breaking strain and a lower drop of stress after failure initiation. Main ﬁnding is that TiAl6V4 lattice structures show brittle behavior and low energy absorption capabilities compared to the ductile behaving 316L lattice structures. For larger strain rates, ultimate tensile strength of TiAl6V4 structures is more than 20% higher compared to lower strain rates due to cold work hardening",FDM or FFF or EAM,0.5,0.64,0.5700000000000001,Metal,0.4,0.49,0.445
61,Meso-scale defect evaluation of selective laser melting using spatially resolved acoustic spectroscopy,"Developments in additive manufacturing technology are serving to expand the potential applications. Critical developments are required in the supporting areas of measurement and in process inspection to achieve this. CM247LC is a nickel superalloy that is of interest for use in aerospace and civil power plants. However, it is difﬁcult to process via selective laser melting(SLM) as it suffers from cracking during rapid cooling and solidiﬁcation. This limits the viability of CM247LC parts created using SLM. To quantify part integrity,spatially resolved a coustic spectroscopy (SRAS) has been identiﬁed as a viable non-destructive evaluation technique. In this study, a combination of optical microscopy and SRAS was used to identify and classify the surface defects present in SLM-produced parts. By analysing the datasets and scan trajectories, it is possible to correlate morphological information with process parameters. Image processing was used to quantify porosity and cracking for bulk density measurement. Analysis of surface acoustic wave data showed that an error in manufacture in the form of an overscan occurred. Comparing areas affected by overscan with a bulk material, a change in defect density from 1.17% in the bulk material to 5.32% in the overscan regions was observed, highlighting the need to reduce overscan areas in manufacture.

Sample B was prepared by mixing process (half volume using conventional casting—
half volume of forging process application SLM). Sample C was prepared by traditional
casting–forging process. Three sets of samples were subjected to the same
process of solution treatment and aging treatment. The microstructures and
mechanical properties of the three groups were studied. The results showed that the
microstructure of sample A was a homogeneous and dense plate-like martensite
structure, and they were different in phase distribution. The microstructure observation
of sample B indicated that the part of the conventional casting-forging process
consisted of martensite and carbide particles, but the SLM process consisted of a
uniformly distributed elongated martensite structure. In the region of different

of rapid manufacturing process that can fabricate functional
parts of any complexity. However, the DMLS process takes
almost 6–12 h to build parts of even small-moderate size.
Reducing the build time of the parts is the key to success of
the DMLS process at commercial level. A common solution
to reduce the part build time is to sinter the parts with maximum
allowable layer thickness. However, doing so will make
staircase effect more prominent and lead to the poor surface
accuracy of the part. In this paper, a bi-criteria-based optimization
approach is presented to address this issue. The subprocesses,
namely, part orientation, layer thickness identification,
and laser scanning directions, are optimized with an aim
to build the parts with: (a) minimum amount of time and (b)
minimum surface inaccuracy. In addition, the material shrinkage

68,Modeling of Multiple Pore Ceramic Materials Fabricated Via Fused Deposition Process,"Porous ceramic materials are used in molten metal filters, light weight core for sandwich panels, radiant burners, catalyst supports, sensors and bone grafts [1–3]. Theoretical and experimental characterization of porous materials are not new and several theories have already been postulated to characterize the mechanical strength of polycrystalline porous ceramics [4–8]. Successful models are available for low-density (,0.3) porous materials such as cellular solids [3]. With regards to high-density (.0.3) porous materials, it has been claimed that although there have been several studies to understand the effects of porosity on mechanical strength, no thorough studies on this problem have been conducted to quantify effect of stress concentrations on mechanical behavior of a porous solid [9]. Three sets of arguments have been presented towards this discussion and they are: (a) the variable nature of stress concentrations for isolated pores, (b) the interactive nature of stress concentrations with increasing porosity so that pores were no longer isolated and (c) interaction of pores and cracks. From theory of elasticity point of view, it has been expressed that exact solutions for multiple pore solutions are difficult to obtain [10]. Some solutions exist for calculating stress concentrations and microfracturing patterns for pores in brittle solids and for evaluating cracks and circular holes in 2-D linear elastic media [11,12]. These elasticity solutions along with the above theories do not clearly show how they could be applied to quantitatively model the mechanical strength degradation behavior of porous solids. There are also many equations cited in literature that have been used to curve fit experimental failure results of porous solids. They are mostly based on empirical constants that are related to the volume fraction porosity and applicable only for certain materials processed under specific conditions.

The results show that an interface with a hierarchical sinusoidal structure has relatively higher fracture resistance ability, especially for mode-II cracks, than an interface with a ﬂat or pure sinusoidal interface.

Design/methodology/approach – Early stages of this study are based on the Taguchi method in establishing rapid prototyping building factors and
their various levels. The ultimate tensile strength, dimension accuracy and surface roughness (SR), are analyzed. Through analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and contribution approximation, significant building factors of each quality characteristic and optimal factors level combinations of each best quality
characteristic are obtained. The main steps are setting the weight for each quality characteristic of the previous Taguchi method, obtaining the
estimated multiple building quality characteristics through integrating the Gray theory, and obtaining a set of optimal building factors. Finally, the result
is verified by the Gray theory and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) evaluation method.
Findings – It is proven that optimal multiple quality characteristic combinations of building factors can be obtained by integrating the Gray theory and
the Taguchi method. The result is further verified by the TOPSIS evaluation method, showing that the model can acquire multiple building quality
characteristics of rapid prototyping.
Research limitations/implications – The method is only applied to FDM in this paper but a similar approach could be applied to other RP systems.
Practical implications – RP system use is limited by low product strength, bad SR, and the high dimension errors. This research demonstrates how
optimizing the FDM process can improve this situation.

Selective laser melting (SLM) is a promising additive manufacturing technique that allows fabrication of
complex functional components via the selective layer-by-layer melting of powder bed particles using a
high-energy laser beam. This technique can allows the production of a wide range of novel high-
performance materials including metal matrix nanocomposites with unique microstructures and supe-
rior properties. In this study, the SLM process was used with various laser-scanning methods to fabricate
cylindrically shaped components from 316L stainless steel reinforced with 15 vol.% TiC nanoparticles. A
deep relationship between the SLM process and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the
resulting components was established to understand the inﬂuence of the selected scanning strategy on
the densiﬁcation, solidiﬁcation microstructure, texture, and anisotropy. It was found that the building
strategy has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the build densiﬁcation, with the highest densiﬁcation obtained
using a cross-hatched scanning strategy. The resulting bimodal grain structure was related to the heat
ﬂowing from the solidifying melt pool (i.e., the developed microstructure depends on the local heat
transfer conditions); the TiC content in the fabricated nanocomposite was also varied according to the
applied scanning method. The relatively strong crystallographic textures along the building and scanning
directions can be transformed into weak ones, and the mechanical properties of the produced compo-
nents can be made nearly isotropic by rotating the scanning vector inside or between the created layers
by 90(cid:1) (known as alternate and cross hatched scanning strategies, respectively) using a single pass of the
laser beam. The obtained results indicate that the utilized laser-scanning strategies allowed tailoring of
the densiﬁcation level, solidiﬁcation microstructure, crystallographic texture, and anisotropy of me-
chanical properties the fabricated parts. Hence, SLM can be successfully used for manufacturing 316L

printed sample density increases gradually with increasing laser energy density and then decreases at an
over-high laser energy density. The microstructure of SLM printed HEA exhibits a large number dislo-

s phase in SLM printed HEA; such nanotwins and s phase have never been observed in either cast or
deformed HEA with true strain below 3.7%. The grain reﬁnement by rapid solidiﬁcation and s phase
synergistically improve the mechanical properties, as compared with conventionally solidiﬁed HEA. Hot

79,Selective laser melting of iron-based powder,"Selective laser melting (SLM) is driven by the need to process near full density objects with mechanical properties comparable to those
of bulk materials. During the process the powder particles are completely molten by the laser beam. The resulting high density allows
avoiding lengthy post-processing as required with selective laser sintering (SLS) of metal powders. Unlike SLS, SLM is more difficult to
control. Because of the large energy input of the laser beam and the complete melting of particles problems like balling, residual stresses
and deformation occur. This paper will describe SLM applied to a mixture of different types of particles (Fe, Ni, Cu and Fe3P) specially

80,"Selective laser melting of stainless steel and alumina composite Experimental and simulation studies on processing parameters, microstructure and mechanical properties","Metal matrix composites (MMC) ﬁnd their uses as high performance materials. The selective laser melting (SLM)
of a 316L stainless steel and Al2O3 MMC is presented in this paper. Agglomerate Al2O3 particles had shown to be
an adequate powder choice with uniform dispersions in the resultant prints. Relative density, phase, microstruc-
ture and mechanical properties of all 1-, 2-, 3-wt% doped products were carefully analyzed. Finite element model-
ing model was developed to study the associated multi-physics phenomena with high efﬁciency for process
parameter optimization. It is found that the change in SLM temperature proﬁle with Al2O3 addition is mainly
due to the change in optical properties rather than thermal. Hence, both simulation and experimentation re-
vealed that higher laser energy input is needed for optimized melting. In addition, cellular dendrites were
found to coarsen with increasing Al2O3 addition due to the decreased cooling rate. With hard particle strength-
ening effects, all samples showed improved hardness with 3-wt% up to 298 HV and 1-wt% samples showing
much improved yielding and tensile stresses of 579 and 662 MPa from 316L. Corresponding microlattice built
this way demonstrated a 30 and 23% increase in speciﬁc strength and energy absorption from that of 316L too.",SLM or DMLS,0.6,0.66,0.63,Metal,0.44,0.61,0.525

prototyping and manufacturing (RP&M). Acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) copolymer has been a popular choice of
material used in fused deposition modeling (FDM), a commonly used RP&M process. However, conventional ABS polymers in
the filamentary form for FDM are known to be of low strength and hardness. In order to overcome this deficiency, ABS was
modified by incorporating several different property modifiers including the short glass fiber, plasticizer, and compatibilizer. Glass
fibers were found to significantly improve the strength of an ABS filament at the expense of reduced flexibility and handleability.
The latter two properties of glass fiber reinforced ABS filaments were improved by adding a small amount of plasticizer and
compatibilizer. The resulting composite filament, prepared by extrusion, was found to work well with a FDM machine.",FDM or FFF or EAM,0.62,0.58,0.6,Polymer,0.54,0.35,0.445

A numeric approximation of the densiﬁcation kinetics is then obtained on the basis of Frenkel, Mackenzie–Shuttleworth, and Einstein–Roscoe models, and optimized sintering conditions for 3D-printed structures are derived.

83,SLM additive manufacturing of Alloy 718 Effect of process parameters on microstructure and properties,"Selective laser melting (SLM) is one type of the Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes as a novel technique to fabricate 3D components in a layer-upon-layer style with less need to post-processing. In the SLM process, samples can be designed by computer-aided design (CAD) software, and produced in any shape. Compared to other AM processes, SLM method presents several advantages, one of which is manufacturing of complex-shape samples with very high accuracy. In SLM process, the microstructure characteristics and mechanical properties can be controlled by changing process parameters. Therefore, SLM process can be used to manufacture many industrial components, e.g. combustion chambers, medical components, and nuclear reactors.  In the present survey, SLM process with different process parameters is used to create 25 cubic samples from Alloy 718 with 10×10×10 mm3 dimension. The as-fabricated samples are cut into two subsets in order to study the influence of two main process parameters including point distance and laser exposure time on the microstructure and properties. The samples are hot mounted to examine the normal reference planes (parallel to build direction). Microstructural characterization has been carried out using Optical Microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Microstructure in the as-fabricated section of samples illustrated highly dendritic growth parallel to build direction in the normal reference planes. The microstructures present some changes within the build direction; the top layers show coarser columnar dendrites compare to the bottom layers with slimmer columnar dendrites owing to a higher cooling rate. SEM/EDS analysis show the presence of some fine phases e.g., Laves and metallic carbides in the γ-matrix and verify the segregation of Nb element in all 25 test samples due to high cooling rate. The porosity content of samples is measured using two methods of image analysis and point counting. The effect of laser energy input, which comprises the effect of laser exposure time and point distance is investigated on the total porosity (round and irregular pores). It is observed that the round porosity content is lower than irregular porosity and the minimum amount of total porosity is around 0.07 vol. % gained at laser energy input of about 265 J/mm3. Mechanical properties is represented by measuring the Micro-Vickers hardness (HV). The microhardness of as-fabricated samples shows a dependency on the laser energy input on the normal reference plane in all the samples. The average microhardness in the as-fabricated samples varies from 291 to 339 HV0.5. ",SLM or DMLS,0.44,0.52,0.48,Ceramic,0.35,0.54,0.445

In this study, in-situ reinforced (ISR) Si3N4 powder and polymer/wax based binder systems were used as filament material for FDC processing using a commercially available FDMTM system, 3D Modeler. Powderlbinder feedstocks were mixed using a torque rheometer and filaments were fabricated using a capillary rheometer and twin screw extruder. Green FDC components were built from these filaments and then characterized for inter-road and inter-layer bonding. Binder removal procedures were established for FDC green components to yield brown parts without distortion or shape change. Brown FDC parts were characterized for carbon residue, pore distribution and dimensional changes. Brown FDC parts were then sintered and the sintered density, microstructure, and shrinkage anisotropy were studied.

85,Study on 3D printing process of continuous carbon fiber reinforced shape memory polymer composites,"In this paper, shape memory polymer (SMP) and continuous carbon fibers (CCF) were utilized as raw materials to manufacture composites by means of 3D printing based on FDM. Various process parameters were systematically studied by the orthogonal experiment to find out the optimal process combination where interfaces and mechanical properties of printed composites specimens were treated as research objectives. The influence of each factor on the performance of the specimen was discussed. The results indicated that the mechanical properties were preferable when the printing temperature was 200°C, the printing speed was 4.5mm/s, the scanning pitch was 1.1 mm, and the ply stacking sequence was 0°. Furthermore, the fiber content had little effect on the shape memory performance of the polymer matrix.

86,Tailoring Selective Laser Melting Process Parameters for NiTi Implants,"Complex-shaped NiTi constructions become more and more essential for biomedical applications especially for dental or cranio-maxillofacial implants. The additive manufacturing method of selective laser melting allows realizing complex-shaped elements with predeﬁned porosity and three-dimensional micro-architecture directly out of the design data. We demonstrate that the intentional modiﬁcation of the applied energy during the SLM-process allows tailoring the transformation temperatures of NiTi entities within the entire construction. Differential scanning calorimetry, x-ray diffraction, and metallographic analysis were employed for the thermal and structural characterizations. In particular, the phase transformation temperatures, the related crystallographic phases, and the formed microstructures of SLM constructions were determined for a series of SLM-processing parameters. The SLM-NiTi exhibits pseudoelastic behavior. In this manner, the properties of NiTi implants can be tailored to build smart implants with pre-deﬁned microarchitecture and advanced performance.

Little knowledge is available for the Polycarbonate (PC) material used in the FDM systems. This paper presents results of the experimental work on the effect of the FDM process parameters such as air gap, raster width, and raster angle on the tensile properties of PC.  Results show that FDM made parts have tensile strength in the range of 70 to 75 % of the moulded and extruded PC parts.

88,Texture control of 316L parts by modulation of the melt pool morphology in selective laser melting,"In this study, 316L parts were fabricated with the selective laser melting additive layer 
manufacturing process using unidirectional laser scan to control their texture. The melt pool 
shape, microstructure and texture of three different cubic samples were analyzed and quantified 
using optical microscopy and electron back-scattered diffraction. The samples scanned along 
the shielding gas flow direction were shown to exhibit shallow conduction melt pools together 
with a strong {110}<001> Goss texture along the laser scanning direction. The sample prepared 
with a laser scan perpendicular to the gas flow direction had deeper melt pools, with a weaker 
{110} <001> Goss texture in addition to a <100> fiber texture parallel to the scanning direction. 
Correlations were proposed between the melt-pool geometry and overlap and the resulting 
texture. The decrease of the melt pool depth was assumed to be linked to local attenuation of 
the laser beam effective power density transmitted to the powder bed.",SLM or DMLS,0.5,0.54,0.52,Ceramic,0.38,0.46,0.42000000000000004

(SLM)   processed   AlSi10Mg   alloy   affected   by   the  processing   parameters   were   systematically   investigated.
The   samples   with   a  single   track   were   produced   by   SLM   to   study   the  inﬂuences   of   laser   power   and   scan-
ning   speed   on  the   surface   morphologies   of  scan   tracks.   Additionally,   the   bulk   samples   were   produced   to
investigate   the  inﬂuence   of   the   laser   power,   scanning   speed,   and   hatch   spacing   on  the   densiﬁcation   level
and   the   resultant   microstructure.   The   experimental   results   showed   that   the  level   of   porosity   of   the   SLM-
processed  samples   was   signiﬁcantly   governed   by   energy   density   of   laser   beam   and   the   hatch   spacing.
The   tensile   properties   of   SLM-processed   samples   and   the   attendant   fracture   surface   can   be   enhanced   by
decreasing   the   level   of  porosity.   The   microstructure   of   SLM-processed   samples   consists   of   supersaturated
Al-rich   cellular   structure   along   with   eutectic   Al/Si   situated   at   the   cellular   boundaries.   The   Si  content   in   the
cellular   boundaries   increases   with   increasing   the   laser   power   and  decreasing   the   scanning   speed.   The
hardness   of  SLM-processed   samples   was   signiﬁcantly   improved   by   this   ﬁne   microstructure   compared
with   the   cast   samples.   Moreover,   the  hardness   of   SLM-processed   samples   at   overlaps   was   lower   than   the

90,The effect of density and feature size on mechanical properties of isostructural metallic foams produced by additive manufacturing,"Simple models describing the relationship between basic mechanical properties and the relative density of various types of porous metals (such as foams, sponges and lattice structures) are well established. Carefully evaluating these relationships experimentally is challenging, however, because of the stochastic structure of foams and the fact that it is difficult to systematically isolate density changes from variations in other factors, such as pore size and pore distribution. Here a new method for producing systematic sets of stochastic foams is employed based on electron beam melting (EBM) additive manufacturing (AM). To create idealised structures, structural blueprints were reverse-engineered by inverting X-ray computed tomographs of a randomly packed bed of glass beads. This three-dimensional structure was then modiﬁed by computer to create ﬁve foams of diﬀerent relative density qr, but otherwise consistent structure. Yield strength and Young’s modulus have been evaluated in compression tests and compared to existing models for foams. A power of 3 rather than a squared dependence of stiffness on relative density is found, which agrees with a recent model derived for replicated foams. A similar power of 3 relation was found for yield strength. Further analysis of the strength of nominally fully dense rods of different diameters built by EBM AM suggest that surface defects mean that the minimum size of features that can be created by EBM with similar strengths to machined samples is 1 mm",SLM or DMLS,0.59,0.66,0.625,Metal,0.53,0.61,0.5700000000000001
91,The Effect of Layer Orientation on the Mechanical Properties and  Microstructure of a Polymer,"Rapid Prototyping (RP) is a method used everywhere from the entertainment industry to healthcare. Layer orientation is an important aspect of the ﬁnal product. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of layer orientation on the mechanical strength and toughness of a polymer. The polymer used was a combination of two materials, ZP 130 and ZB 58, fused together in the Z Corporation Spectrum Z510 Rapid Prototyping Machine. ZP 130 is a powder composed of vinyl polymer (2-20%), sulfate salt (0-5%), and plaster that contains <1% crystalline silica (50-95%). ZB 58 is a liquid composed of glycerol (1-10%), preservative (sorbic acid salt) (0-2%), surfactant (<1%), pigment (<1%), and water (85-95%). After removal from the machine the samples were sealed with Z bond 101 which is Beta-methoxyethyl cyanoacrylate (60-100%). The layer orientations studied were the crack arrestor, crack divider, and short transverse with various combinations of the three, for a total of seven orientations. The mechanical strength was evaluated using tensile testing and three-point bend testing. The toughness was evaluated by Izod impact testing. Five samples for tensile testing and three-point bend testing as well as 15 samples for the Izod impact test for each of the seven orientations were made. The total number of samples was 175. The crack arrestor orientation was the strongest main orientation for the tensile and three-point bend test. Weibull analysis was done on the Izod impact testing due to high variation in the results for the crack arrestor and short transverse directions. It was found that the layer orientation and surface roughness played a signiﬁcant role in the penetration of the Z bond 101 coating and in the overall strength of the samples.

92,The Effects of PLA Color on Material Properties of 3-D Printed Components,"As the number of prosumer printers has expanded rapidly, they now make up the majority of the 3-D printer market and of these printers those in the open-source lineage of the RepRap also have expanded to dominate. Although still primarily used for prototyping or hobbyist production of low-value products, the RepRap has the capacity to be used for high-value distributed manufacturing.  A recent study found that RepRap printed parts printed in realistic environmental conditions can match and even out perform commercial 3-D printers using proprietary FDM in terms of tensile strength with the same polymers. However, tensile strengths of the large sample set of RepRap prints fluctuated. In order to explain that fluctuation and better inform designers on RepRap print properties this study determines the effect of color and processing temperature on material properties of Lulzbot TAZ deposited PLA in various colors. Five colors (white, black, blue, grey, and natural) of commercially available filament processed from 4043D PLA is tested for  for crystallinity with XRD, tensile strength following ASTM D638 and the microstructure is evaluated with environmental scanning electron microscope.  Results are presented showing a strong relationship between tensile strength and percent crystallinity of a 3-D printed sample and a strong relationship between percent crystallinity and the extruder temperature.  Conclusions are drawn about the effects of color and processing temperature on the material properties of 3-D printed PLA to promote the open-source development of RepRap 3-D printing",SLM or DMLS,0.49,0.48,0.485,Ceramic,0.42,0.45,0.435

Defects are easily formed by deviating from optimized processing parameters. This study purposely fabricated Ti-6Al-4V specimens with defects by varying process parameters from the factory default settings in both SLM and EBM equipment. Specimen’s density was measured based on the Archimedes method for estimating porosity. Microscopy of specimen’s top surface were observed to compare melt pool and overlap. “Marginal Parameters” is identified to describe the processing parameters which are capable of fabricating specimens with certain porosity. As a result, a correlation between defect regularity and marginal parameters has been established.

94,"The guide to glass 3D printing developments, methods, diagnostics and results","Purpose – This purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the steps and processes behind successfully adapting novel materials, namely virgin
glass and recycled glass, to three-dimensional printing (3DP).
Design/methodology/approach – The transition from 3DP ceramic systems to glass systems will be examined in detail, including the necessary
modifications to binder systems and printing parameters. The authors present preliminary engineering data on shrinkage, porosity, and density as
functions of peak firing temperature, and provide a brief introduction to the complexities faced in realizing an adequate and repeatable firing method
for 3D printed glass.
Findings – Shrinkage behavior for the 3D printed recycled glass showed significant anisotropy, especially beyond peak firing temperatures of 7308C.
The average shrinkage ratios for the slow- and fast-axes to the Z-axis were 1:1.37 and 1:2.74, respectively. These extreme differences can be attributed
to the layer-by-layer production method and binder burn-off. At 7608C, the apparent porosity reached a minimum of 0.36 percent, indicative of
asymptotic behavior that approaches a fully dense 3DP glass specimen. At low firing temperatures, the bulk density was similar to water, but increased
to a maximum of 2.41 g/cm3. This indicates that 3DP recycled glass can behave similarly to common glass with accepted published bulk densities
ranging from 2.4-2.8 g/cm3.
Research limitations/implications – Heating schedule analysis and optimization may reduce geometric variations, therefore, the firing method
should be investigated in greater depth.
Originality/value – This paper provides a guide to successfully adopting glass to commercially available 3DP hardware. This research has also enabled
rapid prototyping of recycled glass, a monumental step towards a sustainable future for 3DP.",SLM or DMLS,0.68,0.65,0.665,Metal,0.57,0.51,0.54

with a Replicating Rapid prototyper (Rep-Rap) 3D printer, by varying three important process parameters: layer thickness, infill orientation and the number
of shell perimeters. Little information is currently available about mechanical properties of parts printed using open-source, low-cost 3D printers.
Design/methodology/approach – A computer-aided design model of a tensile test specimen was created, conforming to the ASTM:D638.
Experiments were designed, based on a central composite design. A set of 60 specimens, obtained from combinations of selected parameters, was
printed on a Rep-Rap Prusa I3 in PLA. Testing was performed using a JJ Instruments – T5002-type tensile testing machine and the load was measured
using a load cell of 1,100 N.
Findings – This study investigated the main impact of each process parameter on mechanical properties and the effects of interactions. The use
of a response surface methodology allowed the proposition of an empirical model which connects process parameters and mechanical properties.
Even though results showed a high variability, additional ideas on how to understand the impact of process parameters are suggested in this paper.
Originality/value – On the basis of experimental results, it is possible to obtain practical suggestions to set common process parameters in relation
to mechanical properties. Experiments discussed in the present paper provide a variety of data and insight regarding the relationship among the
main process parameters and the stiffness and strength of fused deposition modeling-printed parts made from PLA. In particular, this paper
underlines the shortage in existing literature concerning the impact of process parameters on the elastic modulus and the strain to failure for the

96,Thermo-mechanical Characterization of MetalPolymer Composite Filaments and Printing Parameter Study for Fused Deposition Modeling in the 3D Printing Process,"New metal/polymer composite filaments for fused deposition modeling (FDM) processes were developed in order to observe the thermo-mechanical properties of the new filaments. The acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) thermoplastic was mixed with copper and iron particles. The percent loading of the metal powder was varied to confirm the effects of metal particles on the thermo-mechanical properties of the filament, such as tensile strength and thermal conductivity. The printing parameters such as temperature and fill density were also varied to see the effects of the parameters on the tensile strength of the ﬁnal product which was made with the FDM process. As a result of this study, it was conﬁrmed that the tensile strength of the composites is decreased by increasing the loading of metal particles. Additionally, the thermal conductivity of the metal/polymer composite filament was improved by increasing the metal content. It is believed that the metal/polymer filament could be used to print metal and large-scale 3-dimensional (3D) structures without any distortion by the thermal expansion of thermoplastics. The material could also be used in 3D printed circuits and electromagnetic structures for shielding and other applications.

Sr-MBG scaffolds were used to repair critical-sized rat calvarial defects. The results showed that
Sr-MBG scaffolds possessed good apatite-forming ability and stimulated MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation
and differentiation. Importantly, the in vivo results revealed that Sr-MBG scaffolds had good osteogenic
capability and stimulated new blood vessel formation in critical-sized rat calvarial defects within
